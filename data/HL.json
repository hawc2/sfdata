totally misheard and thought this was going to be a sequel about Bernie Focker. Still good, though!","1":"Great movie that shares a very wide range of emotions","2":"Despite a minimal narrative arc, the film does contain some gripping action scenes and a sense of unpredictability that keeps us guessing until the end.","3":"Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is something I felt was different in a war film. Rather than focusing the film in the reasons why the country goes into war but rather the reason why a soldier wants to be in the war. It details on the experience of these soldiers in their placement in Iraq. This is also the film that made Kathryn Bigelow and Oscar contending director and has proven herself again in her next war film, Zero Dark Thirty.The plot of the film is a bomb squad that consists of William James (Renner), J.T. Sanborn (Mackie) and Owen Eldridge (Geraghty) doing their service until their rotation is over. The screenplay by Mark Boal captures the deep experiences of these soldiers very realistically. It doesn't try to take notice of the audience using large action and chaotic sequences but rather explore these soldiers' feelings towards their duty and the psychological trauma they endured. I enjoyed the storyline with Eldgridge trying to understand death and trying to shake the fact that one moment you are here and the next you aren't. But the main focus is on James as his reason is that he loves his job and that he would risk his own life, even though he has a \"family\" back home, to feel the adrenaline pumping. I love that it shows how is actions affect others, especially those close to him professionally and personally. Boal seems to understand the war at a more intimate level, which he did with this film, and he also can see war in a much more bigger picture like in his second film Zero Dark Thirty.Kathryn Bigelow is a filmmaker that I feel neutral to as she has entertaining films like this one and also has not-so-good ones like Blue Steel and The Loveless. I feel that her next few films after Zero Dark Thirty will really show whether or not she will be the next great director. This film is a fantastic drama of war and this is maybe because Bigelow is handling the film, and also has a great script. If this film was in the hands of more action oriented directors then this may been half an hour shorter and would spend less time on characters but instead on situations.The film doesn't move really fast in my opinion and so great editing in scenes is needed to keep the audience interested. Memorable and thrilling moments like the sniper battle do stretch for a bit with minimal action but with great editing keeps you in the edge of your seat as anything could happen.One of the stronger aspects of the film is the cinematography by Barry Ackroyd who did the other war film I enjoyed, Green Zone. This film, that Ackroyd also did for Green Zone, is very gritty by keeping the image very grainy. It's appropriate for the setting and the theme. There are moments that are captured uniquely and may be a little bit pretentious. I see it as ambitious and makes the film different from the war films in recent years. The use of shaky cam in order to create a sense chaos and anxiety may be a little too much but I have seen so many of these in films that it does not bother me so, but I do acknowledge that it is there and it isn't for everyone. The most beautiful moments that Ackroyd has captured is the slow motion events, whether it is the blowing up of a bomb or the fall of a bullet form a fired gun, it is breathtaking.Beltrami and Sanders' score is not dominating but it is eerie and dark which supports the experiences of these tortured soldiers. There are a lot of moments where it is complete silence in creating a sense of tension but when certain situations happen, their score starts to haunt the scene.The film has three convincing and breakout leads. They made these guys potential blockbuster acotrs, especially Renner. They fill in the shoes of these characters with such depth and vulnerability. I adore that these are not expendable characters that just have 2 or 3 emotions. The film includes appearances of great actors in small roles like Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce. Their roles may be small but it is strong and definitely something noteworthy. Their appearance feels like there is weight when something happens to them.This film is not trying to make a statement about war but the soldiers that go in and do the hard work. This film may in the future be regarded as a war classic due to its subjective approach and is well deserving of its accolades. If you want a visual spectacle in its approach to war then don't watch this but if a study of soldiers is what gets your interest then sure try this out.","4":"Worth the best picture win.","5":"A better version of Jarhead. Keeps you glued to the screen the whole time. A lot of intensity with surprisingly little actual action.","6":"A suspenseful movie with great action!","7":"The Hurt Locker is a masterfully directed, powerful war thriller that is full of great performances and palpably intense action scenes.","8":"Interesting. Grabs u. Slow and fast and loud. And very quiet. And scary for what it does to people. Good film. Terrible topic. We so have no clue what's going on.","9":"Critically acclaimed, super suspenseful scenes. Couldn't figure out what story arc was supposed to link the scenes.","10":"The story of an elite army bomb squad lead by an action junkie(Renner) who is continually putting his fellow soldiers in danger. Incredibly well acted by the two virtually unknown leads with great performances peppered in from an all-star cast of veterans. Amazing actions scenes(the first bomb is a show stopper). The film manages to really capture the constant tension of working as a soldier well filming the movie in a documentary style.","11":"One of the best war movies in existence.","12":"A truly amazing war epic that depicts one of America's most complicated conflicts. Following an Army bomb squad, this action-filled film is one of the best in many years. It's superb performances, especially by the lead Jeremy Renner (\"The Avengers\") , director Kathryn Bigelow's fantastic artistic talent, and the pure audacity that this one rises too is unmatchable. It almost never falters in it's suspense and thrill, and always keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats. \"The Hurt Locker\" is a movie landmark of the 21st Century, don't miss out on seeing this one.","13":"Jeremy Renner is one of my favourite actors, and I've not met a person who has disliked this film","14":"An epic realistic war film about a bomb squad within the Iraq War. Every action scene is memorable due to its tense, isolated feeling, you get the true sense that war can be extremely blind and at some points your shooting at nothing just to defend yourself. Jeremy Renner puts in an award winning performance which really put him on the map as an action star, and really fits the part. He perfectly depicts a man addicted to the thrills of war, and once getting into it, he just can't get back to the simplistic lifestyle back at home, as much as he forces himself to think that he can. War becomes a part of a man's blood stream when they get too deep.","15":"The Hurt Locker hits with the might of Spike Lee's Malcolm X, and the grit of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver. It depicts some of the most involving characters ever displayed in a war film through shots so intense and with so many cuts, you can't look away, even if you want to. It is the best movie of the decade. Jeremy Renner couldn't have found a better venture to finally display his talent to the world.","16":"More proof to the fact that the oscars are a joke, A shallow supposed-to-be thrilling & realistic war piece that fails to give any insight about its main theme or anything at all, It even can't depicts its Wars Is A Drug thing in a convincing way, Not to mention the film's not so obvious one-sidedness, Mind you the film has a few interesting moments but not enough to save it from the abyss","17":"I just watched it. great movie, very intense","18":"Watched this for one main reason, Jeremy Renner. Great actor. The movie i was a long time ago. I remember that it was pretty good.","19":"This movie is getting a lot of awards and buzz. I may have been going in with too high of expectations because although it was good I don't know that it was that good. The acting was good. It was an intense story and I can't even imagine how anyone can live like that under the constant threat of attack or being blown up, and that is when they are not even doing the bomb disposal thing. My problem is that the main character makes bad decisions that throws his team into life treatening situations. And instead of learning from his mistakes he keeps going back and making more bad decisions. The movie is good, but I just didn't like the main character enough to enjoy the journey.","20":"so dull. they walk a bit. defuse a bomb. walk a bit more. don't bother with it, not sure why it got such great reviews. I found it really boring, nothing really happened in the whole movie.","21":"Underlines effectively the dangers of emotion and anguish during a war. It holds your attention throughout. A well deserved Oscar nomination for Jeremy Renner.","22":"Why do I feel like I am the only person that realizes that this movie is complete drivel. Absurdly cliched characters put in completely unrealistic (but entirely predictable) situations with no semblance of character development outside of what you already know about the cookie cutter personalities from other stories. Admittedly, the first scene is fantastically shot, but it offers little outside of cinematography. From the moment you see the robot whizzing amongst the rubble you know things aren't going to end well for a character you're supposed to \"like\". Sadly, I know I'm supposed to like this character, but I just don't. Kathryn Bigelow makes it clear exactly how you are supposed to feel about the characters, but I had nothing but ambivalence throughout. Much of the problems with this movie I feel comes from an agenda on the part of the director. Too often I found the movie telling me what I should be thinking or feeling instead of making me think or feel it organically. In the end I did feel a bit of something: empathy for Jeremy Renner's character. Like him, I had become numb to the whole experience of the war which is being portrayed; a dull numbness to the struggles around me, not caring about anyone or anything [in the movie].","23":"One of the greatest movies I have ever seen.","24":"It more than lives up to its opening quote - \"the rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug\". Edge of your seat suspense without violence overkill. Jeremy Renner is great and I like that it is a film about him as an individual as much as war as a whole, i.e. it serves to promote no political agenda re the war in Iraq... refreshing.","25":"Story of a bomb disabling squad in the Iraq war, doesn't really have a plot, but nonetheless stays interesting with the episodic narrative structure. Shows the realistic side of the Iraq War, but overall just an okay film.","26":"saw this before it got all the oscar buzz, and as soon as i saw it, i added it to the list of \"i've never seen anything so tense in my life\" list.","27":"The BEST Movie of 2009 and well deserved the Oscar, I still can't believe all the people who doesn't get the message and the fear that involves the entire story, probably they need to watch it again and try to feel the characters but I know they'll not going to do it because they couldn't the first time","28":"It is a great movie that I feel may just be a tad overrated. Fantastic work from Jeremy Renner as the lead.","29":"This film is very real. TOO real.","30":"Original, Raw, Powerful.

I've never fought in a war but this kinda seems accurate to me. The tension and intensity is definitely there. It also deals with the psychology of a soldier, the toll of war on the mind and how different soldiers deal with it all.","33":"If you hate this movie, then you can just go diffuse an IED.","34":"Very disappointing - kings new clothes?

This is not even a movie, just a number of disconnected sketches.","36":"Awesome movie thats all that needs to be said","37":"No Point Break.Shaky cameras galore.The first quote is faux-deep.

A todo ello se le suma las muy buenas y convincentes actuaciones y un apartado visual brillante, dando como resultado un filme que logra ser diferente y destacar incluso con las imperfecciones anteriormente mencionadas.","39":"I Did See The Bourne Legacy Back In 2012 Durning NISRA's Critics' Night Out At Classic Cinemas In Woodstock, IL.","40":"This is Jeremy Renner's best movie.","41":"A stunning film that goes to show that you don't need a ton of shots to be fired to make a scene tense as hell. Well written, and superbly acted, it's a thrilling modern war film that needs to be seen.","42":"amazing film, and we'll acted","43":"Amazing third act and brilliant performances by Renner and Mackie.","44":"A film concerning the Iraq war that is not over loaded with explosions, crude dialogue, or a one-sided moralistic tone, is welcome. Well done Kathryn Bigelow for this taut, technically gorgeous piece of cinema. I said it is a film concerning Iraq but really it could be any war, as it is an interesting study of the effects of intense combat on soldiers, and how its psychological hooks go deep.","45":"Poderia ser um document\u00e1rio ficcional, se n\u00e3o fosse a dire\u00e7\u00e3o de Kathryn Bigelow que cria cenas de suspense eletrizantes e as atua\u00e7\u00f5es verdadeiras de todo o elenco - principalmente Jeremy Renner, que lidera o filme com perfei\u00e7\u00e3o.","46":"Woman directing a war film,good achievement","47":"This movie is a perfect example and re-enforces the fact that oscars ARE biased. People who rated high for the movie are doing so because they are idiots!","48":"A very compelling movie, which has a lot of hard hitting moments. The film work itself is truly a masterpiece and the story is brilliantly played out. Renner is a star as always, I have yet to see a bad film with him on the cast list. Bigelows directorial debut is brilliant and she is someone to be watched.","49":"Extremely tense and nerve-racking. Very well-shot and well-acted.","50":"I will review this with a story. I was watching this movie, while at work on a night shift, when there was a lull in the action of my job. I was right at the scene where the main character is attempting to diffuse a car bomb, with limited success initially. At about the peak of the scenes intensity, my pager went off and my heart nearly stopped with fear. This is a prime example of the intensity of the film. This is what I THOUGHT \"The Kingdom\" would be. While there is no true \"plot\" per se, the fact that at times I forgot that the extras likely are also actors, and that we were watching a documentary on bomb disposal, should speak volumes of the reality of the film, and therefore it's quality. Best picture? Meh, who cares. That is a popularity contest and one person's best picture is another's worst (remember, the original Star Wars is beloved by millions but didn't win best picture either). But is it worth seeing. For me, absolutely.","51":"Hands down, best film of the year... so far","52":"Sergeant William James: Everyone's a coward about something.

An intense and artistic film that won't disappoint. Don't miss out on this one.","58":"This movie honestly feels like they tried too hard. Far too much shaky cam when it's unnecessary.I gave it 5 stars when I first watched it but upon rewatch it has dropped considerably.","59":"The Hurt Locker is a good example of why it's hard for me to enjoy modern war films. Unlike films about Vietnam or WWII, The Hurt Locker and others seem to focus more on some American supposed-to-be-badass-but-in-reality-is-ASU-fraternity-level-douchebag than the actual tragic beauty that every war has. This film actually had some good moments, but the aftertaste was unbearable. The ending was so atrocious that it actually surprised me. I had some hope that it would end with him trying to pick out cereal, because that would have been an okay ending, but they just had to go and ruin it. They ruined it and that's all I have to say.","60":"As his men struggle to understand his death wish, his true character is revealed that will affect every man.

I think I missed something.","64":"7,5\/10good but to much hype","65":"The Hurt Locker succeeds as a great film due to the direction of Kathryn Bigelow as well as the gripping suspense, the very well shot action scenes, the acting performances given by Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie as well as Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes and finally the film is incredibly realistic unlike some war films of the last few years","66":"Pretty decent movie. Not sure why I enjoy watching these soldiers in the Middle east kinda movies. Is that bad?","67":"i cant believe i just heard about this movie. it looks spectacular!","68":"A Hitchcockian quality and a continuous tension that doesn't let u go for a moment...","69":"One of the top 10 films of the decade. That's right. Watch it!","70":"Upon second viewing, I liked it even more. Full of suspense and a powerhouse lead performance from Jeremy Renner","71":"Regardless of whether its \"true\" or not.... This is one of the best movies I've seen.","72":"Repetitive, unengaging, stale, etc. Ironic and sad that this ended up being the picture that gave Renner his name. A lot of flat characters arguing about petty things, trying to prove their manliness. If nothing else, the film gives viewers some good reasons not to join the armed forces.","73":"adiccion a la adrenalina","74":"A+. A powerful film propulsed by an original script.","75":"so intense and badass!","76":"In a realistic manner that Hits the viewer and captures their minds faster than most war films could dream of doing,The Hurt Locker makes excellent use of silence in it's storyline to project the intensity of the story without displaying breakthrough musical techniques to do so, and so the experience becomes simple and memorable for it, much like in Witness or Animal Kingdom. It becomes all the more realistic through the intense silence and the great cast in their excellent portrayal of realistic war dynamics, and so the buildup to the climax of this moment is one of the most powerful in war film history. So by the end of the intro, it's quickly cemented that The Hurt Locker is going to be a very powerful war film.For some viewers, the atmosphere may be worn down by the slow pacing, but the simple fact is that The Hurt Locker is one of the most character-driven war films to have existed in many years, and is one of the best to dramatise the war in Iraq.One interesting thing is the way that Jeremy Renner reminds us that his character is still human through mere use of costume change, in the sequence where he pulls a gun on a DVD salesman and returns to the mans house, and the entire sequence removes the audiences thought of him as a soldier and it becomes solidified that his character is merely a very strong human. However, in a stronger manner to lean to his characterisation is Jeremy Renner's fine performance.He levels humanity with determination and supplies a powerful breakout lead with just the character needed for The Hurt Locker. The entire cast is good, but Jeremy Renner carries them all very well and just provides excellent realism to it all.But the praise must be given to Katheryn Bigelow, not just for her decision to cast unknown actors and for handling the Iraq war so finely, but because of the inspiration from the fact that she is the first woman to win the Academy Award for best director and the fact that she proved how a woman may handle such a subject as well as anyone else which surely would disprove many chauvinistic thoughts of people worldwide. And it doesn't even change things because she's just a person who made a fine film, one so fine that it won the Academy Award for best picture. And the fact is, her knowledge of handling intensity and great action as we've learned from her action flick Point Break, it's obvious she's just the perfect director for a war film and delivers even more substance to the story than you could expect. Her handling of The Hurt Locker was just immaculate, and so she's the reason that it's all too memorable.So The Hurt Locker was a great simple look at characters experiencing the Iraq war, and it's one of the finest looks at it that the film industry can provide.","77":"Make that \"Really Want to See It\".","78":"i literally lived the experience. :)","79":"Maybe I would of liked this film more if it had an actual story...","80":"Another overrated and undeserved oscar winner. I can't believe Avatar lost direction to this. Jeremy Renner is fantastic, though.","81":"Jeremy Renner burst onto the scene in a big way in Kathryn Bigelow's award winning Hurt Locker.This is an incredible war film which manages to be memorable despite no real solid plot, instead relying on a few set pieces and incredible acting from the \"Bravo Squad\" - Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty. Also making a splash are small but memorable roles for veteran actors Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes.This is the sort of film that leaves a lasting impression in your mind. Great film.","82":"This movie is almost like a documentary of war and how it effects an individuals life to be out in the rough of it. It's a stark reality of what war is truly like. Although this movie is brutally realistic and brings you the viewer to the front line it allows us to hopefully learn a greater respect for those great warriors that risk all so that we can be a free nation. There are several war films out there but I feel that this one gives a more honest feel of what war is like in our day and age. It's far from pretty but it is a necessary reality as long as there are nations that hate free enterprise and a free way of life. I feel people everywhere should have the right to choose to live their lives as they see fit.If we as a nation learn to hate the freedoms we have enjoyed for the past 2-3 centuries we will have had so many good men and women die in vain. May our nation never stop loving free enterprise and stay a free nation under God.God bless the men and women who fight in the armed forces of the United States of America! They give so much so that we can have what seems so ordinary and common to us. One only needs to nearly cross the borders of a nation in the middle-east to see what they do not have.3 1\/2 out 5 Stars","83":"As a United States soldier, this movie is complete crap. I didn't see a single thing they did that would go along with what we really do and how we have to operate. the story line was so weak that they had to create trouble that would not have happened if they did it how we do. I'm tired of Hollywood portraying us as crazy cowboys for no reason. As a film this movie was very well acted and we framed. The director captured the intensity of war as if you were there first person. The story line was a little weak but it did flow and was entertaining. It defiantly should not have won any awards","84":"Much like Bigelow's later film Zero Dark Thirty, this is a strong representation of the modern war film genre. It's no surprise that it won her the Best Director Oscar, it's powerful stuff without glorifying the conflict, from either side's perspective. It's a wee bit long though, that's my only criticism.","85":"Simple yet very effective.","86":"I had been looking forward to seeing this one for quite a while, and I wasn't disappointed. Cinematography was good, and included some impressive sequences. (It is a bit weird to adjust to the aspect ratio early on in the film, because it was shot on 16mm.)I liked the tension built in the \"mini-action\" sequences throughout the film, and also found myself intrigued by the three very different members of the film's focal EOD unit and how they were effected by the experience in war time.","87":"The best film of the 2000s in my opinion, it's portrait of man's needless addiction and dependence on war is Bigelow's spotlight feature. This film gives tension a new name and meaning, I was never not thrilled by what was going on, easily one of the finest war films of all-time.","88":"Does a great job of showing the human aspect of war, especially the stress that EOD guys go through.","89":"Kathryn Bigelow's Hurt Locker is one of the very best films of the decade. Anthony Mackie and Jeremy Renner in carrear defining roles. This film demands to be seen.","90":"Intense and gritty, The Hurt Locker is a film you won't want to miss. Renner and Mackie's chemistry is worth the watch, including the directing by Bigelow.","91":"3.5\/5 Watched it again recently and I still don't see what the big deal is. I do like the movie and it does have some incredible scenes, but as a whole it is just really good...not what I think of as a masterpiece.","92":"The actors were great and so was the directing. So far one of the best takes on the Iraq war. Very intense scenes! I thought everyone was going to get blown up, that's how intense it was. I have a new respect for all of those bomb technicians disarming all of those roadside bombs.","93":"Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is something I felt was different in a war film. Rather than focusing the film in the reasons why the country goes into war but rather the reason why a soldier wants to be in the war. It details on the experience of these soldiers in their placement in Iraq. This is also the film that made Kathryn Bigelow and Oscar contending director and has proven herself again in her next war film, Zero Dark Thirty.The plot of the film is a bomb squad that consists of William James (Renner), J.T. Sanborn (Mackie) and Owen Eldridge (Geraghty) doing their service until their rotation is over. The screenplay by Mark Boal captures the deep experiences of these soldiers very realistically. It doesn't try to take notice of the audience using large action and chaotic sequences but rather explore these soldiers' feelings towards their duty and the psychological trauma they endured. I enjoyed the storyline with Eldgridge trying to understand death and trying to shake the fact that one moment you are here and the next you aren't. But the main focus is on James as his reason is that he loves his job and that he would risk his own life, even though he has a \"family\" back home, to feel the adrenaline pumping. I love that it shows how is actions affect others, especially those close to him professionally and personally. Boal seems to understand the war at a more intimate level, which he did with this film, and he also can see war in a much more bigger picture like in his second film Zero Dark Thirty.Kathryn Bigelow is a filmmaker that I feel neutral to as she has entertaining films like this one and also has not-so-good ones like Blue Steel and The Loveless. I feel that her next few films after Zero Dark Thirty will really show whether or not she will be the next great director. This film is a fantastic drama of war and this is maybe because Bigelow is handling the film, and also has a great script. If this film was in the hands of more action oriented directors then this may been half an hour shorter and would spend less time on characters but instead on situations.The film doesn't move really fast in my opinion and so great editing in scenes is needed to keep the audience interested. Memorable and thrilling moments like the sniper battle do stretch for a bit with minimal action but with great editing keeps you in the edge of your seat as anything could happen.One of the stronger aspects of the film is the cinematography by Barry Ackroyd who did the other war film I enjoyed, Green Zone. This film, that Ackroyd also did for Green Zone, is very gritty by keeping the image very grainy. It's appropriate for the setting and the theme. There are moments that are captured uniquely and may be a little bit pretentious. I see it as ambitious and makes the film different from the war films in recent years. The use of shaky cam in order to create a sense chaos and anxiety may be a little too much but I have seen so many of these in films that it does not bother me so, but I do acknowledge that it is there and it isn't for everyone. The most beautiful moments that Ackroyd has captured is the slow motion events, whether it is the blowing up of a bomb or the fall of a bullet form a fired gun, it is breathtaking.Beltrami and Sanders' score is not dominating but it is eerie and dark which supports the experiences of these tortured soldiers. There are a lot of moments where it is complete silence in creating a sense of tension but when certain situations happen, their score starts to haunt the scene.The film has three convincing and breakout leads. They made these guys potential blockbuster acotrs, especially Renner. They fill in the shoes of these characters with such depth and vulnerability. I adore that these are not expendable characters that just have 2 or 3 emotions. The film includes appearances of great actors in small roles like Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce. Their roles may be small but it is strong and definitely something noteworthy. Their appearance feels like there is weight when something happens to them.This film is not trying to make a statement about war but the soldiers that go in and do the hard work. This film may in the future be regarded as a war classic due to its subjective approach and is well deserving of its accolades. If you want a visual spectacle in its approach to war then don't watch this but if a study of soldiers is what gets your interest then sure try this out.","94":"Damn good movie. Damn good acting. And a damn good story.","95":"This one gets a 5 stars from me. By far, one of the best war movie of all time. Overwhelmingly TENSE that sometimes I forget to breathe from one terrifying scene to another more terrifying scene. The hurt locker is not a typical gun blasting combat movie but the mania of diffusing bombs under extreme circumstances in war torn Iraq(filmed in Jordan, country next to it) Th direction from Kathryn Bigelow was downright realistic and damn well near perfect. The Hurt Locker is structured around the 38 days the three men in the EOD (for Explosive Ordnance Disposal) squad have left in their rotation in Iraq. Men like Spc. Owen Eldridge (Geraghty) know all too well that every new day is potentially one they will not survive. They all want to avoid the hurt locker, the place where bad things happen. The 3 male leads especially Jeremy Renner, brought such unchallenged performances along with some special guest cameos by Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes. This is a must see film and easily the best of 2009. Whoever says transformers 2 the best, I will hurt you!","96":"Hollywood has most definitely figured out how to depict American heroism on screen.","97":"good action military flick, lots of suspense","98":"This was a major disappointment. The explosions were unrealistic and everything about it was just ridiculous. I used rotten tomatoes as a resource to find good movies and at this measure rotten tomatoes is sucking really bad.","99":"Turns out, The Hurt Locker deserved it.","100":"What a movie. Intense, thrilling, terrifying and overall compelling, The Hurt Locker is a powerful war epic brilliantly directed by Kathryn Bigelow. Throughout the film, it feels like you are watching a documentary and you are in the war zone with real soldiers. Gripping all the way through. It's a great piece of work.","101":"The Hurt Locker is a modern war film about the deployments of troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other countries that supposedly were Al Queda bases and the struggles that they faced. We mainly focus on three main soldiers who are waiting for the last day of deployment and getting sent home. Will they all make it through alive to the final day? Well, the film sure keeps that suspense throughout the runtime I'll say that much. Every scene where the soldiers are trying to accomplish a mission in a battlefield, it is extremely intense and horrifying. This movie is no pillow fight that's for sure. There's suicide bombers, violent shootings, TONS of explosives, and much more. It's utter hell and it doesn't shy away from showing how terrible these conditions are for the soldiers. The setting in Iraq looks beautiful cinematography wise, but is scary when you put the story aside it. The best part of the film, in my opinion, is the cast. Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty, and Ralph Fiennes were really good in this movie and brought forth memorable characters. Jeremy Renner in specific felt like a total war hero amongst them all. The scene where he carries a boy to safety after being stuffed with a bomb was a heartfelt scene that showed what this man is all about, and that is justice. I wouldn't call this a proud American film just because it's kinda gruesome and hard to swallow at some points and it's not trying to be patriotic either. It's just trying to get the point across that it's a terrifying place to be, but you are defending your country with your life. The story is kinda loosely tied in my opinion, there's no real storyline per-say but just one main focus, which is to survive the deployment and save lives of innocent people. It's a good story no doubt, but not an exceedingly strong one. The chemistry between the characters existed and I thought it was nice, but Mackie and Renner's relationship was the best in the film by far. Despite their disagreements with each other and opposing views, they knew they had to get along in the long run. The action, like I said before, is amazing. The opening scene to this movie sent shivers down my spine from intensity. It was really refreshing to see a film that can create more suspense than a good horror movie, mainly because it's a real life horror. There's no specific scene I'd take out of this film mainly because they all play an important part in the story telling process. That's when you know you've found an above average film. The Hurt Locker was a wonderful movie about a not so wonderful situation that Americans have to deal with on a daily basis. Kathryn Bigelow really outdid herself in this epic war tale. A-","102":"For what this movie is, it's pretty good. I must say the cinematography is very well done.","103":"A grueling, but engaging look at the conflict in Iraq avoids being just another war movie by telling its story through three bomb squad members, all of whom are played very well. Runs a bit long, but the emotional investment in the interesting characters and subject matter don't suffer significantly.","104":"Probbaly the best movie about modern warfare. Not a lot of action but it has some very tense scenes and it explores the effects of the war on people superbly. The performances are excellent from everyone. Bigelow creates a tense atmosphere very well, even in the more dramatic scenes because we already know the effects of war and how they've gone a little crazy and hectic.","105":"A suspenseful and thrilling war film from director Kathryn Bigelow, The Hurt Locker is a smart and uncompromising look at the lives of soldiers serving in Iraq. The story follows a bomb disposal unit as they go out on missions to deal with car bombs, suicide bombers, and IEDs, but the team leader's wild and reckless attitude soon pushes his team members to their breaking point. Jeremy Renner gives an outstanding performance, and is able to convey a lot through subtle looks and movements. Additionally, there are some strong supporting performances by Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, and Evangeline Lilly. Bigelow's directing is also incredibly well-done and gives the film a gritty and raw quality. And, the writing's remarkably tight and keeps the focus on the soldiers and their personal struggles; avoiding any political commentary about the war. A provocative character drama, The Hurt Locker asks some hard questions about the effects that war has on the soldiers who fight it.","106":"How do you fight an enemy that you can't see? If you shoot first, you're the villain. If you don't, then you're dead. The Hurt Locker shows that everyone has their limits when the possibility of death looms at every second of every day. Long drawn out battles convey just how tense and unpredictable the modern incarnation of war is.","107":"His rank was Sgt. First Class not Staff Sgt. But loved it","108":"The film that made Jeremy Renner a household name, brilliant performance by Renner and a well-deserved Oscar nomination.","109":"I seriously don't get where this movie is heading to. The lead is courageous but then there's nothing much to the movie after that.","110":"A gripping, intense, impactful, and thoughtful war movie, The Hurt Locker is worthy of all those awards that it won.","111":"How many movies would give a scene in which two thirsty soldiers stare at a building the realistic time and room to breathe? This movie does. This movie feels and hurts real. William James' progression from cocky IED specialist to human, likeable, leader is wonderful to watch. The fact that it is all shot beautifully is icing.","112":"Most war movies are very simple in presentation - lacking \"in-your-face\"-visuals. Of course it depends on the war, and this one is a very clear, straight-eyed portrait.","113":"Lacking a narrative arc. There's no central conflict to keep the audience interested. Instead it's just repetitive unrealistic war scenes, and it really drags throughout its long running time. Yawn.","114":"Great film, but I just wasn't terribly interested.","115":"A serious and brutally emotional war film centered around three characters of different temperaments. The lack of music and the clever use of silence successfully dials up the intensity in each bomb disarming mission. Despite the lack of a central story arc, emotions and character psychology are the qualities that carry the film. Suggested by the film's great writing and acting, we empathize with our three major characters and delve ourselves into their complex minds that speaking cannot elucidate.","116":"Bigelow plants you right in the middle of the situations at hand, and as a result produces a gripping, suspenseful and occasionally emotion portrayal of war.","117":"Favourite War Movie of All Time!","118":"My full opinion: 8.3\/10.","119":"excellent really intense","120":"Was okay but why so many Oscars ???","121":"Unbelievable the director is a woman","122":"It is such a well done movie with Bigelow showing mastery in meaningful scenes with the camera, control in creating intensity and a great performance from the lead Jeremy Renner.","123":"This film is the bomb","124":"It's an ok movie but I didn't think it was good enough to win the Oscar.","125":"Very gripping and intense, The Hurt Locker is by far one of the best war movies ever made. A very well acted and put together movie that is unlike any other war film. The thing that separates this from other war films is the touch of realism and tension. There is always a problem lurking and it is nearly impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen. Jeremy Renner gives the performance of his career and the rest of the cast was excellent. Many people seem to hate this movie because it was \"slow\". Well this isnt an action packed war movie. Its a more realistic, character driven take on the horrors of war. The Hurt Locker rightfully deserved all the Oscars it got including Best Picture and is surely one of the best war movies ever made.","126":"Bomb by bomb, Kathryn Bigelow crafts one of most suspenseful movies ever made, war flick or otherwise.","127":"Perfectly competent, really well shot, with some very tense action scenes and great performances, but not much substance or depth. It's basically 2 hours of Act 1, without any Act 2 or 3.","128":"One of the best war movies I've seen. So real, very well done. I hope Kathryn Bigelow takes the Oscar.","129":"Technically well made but complete bullshit propaganda.","130":"Great movie, great acting, great directing. A+!","131":"Did not understand the point.","132":"An overrated war film with no emotion, bland character development, and an awful ending. There are some good action scenes, though.","133":"This war movie is as real as it gets.","134":"I've seen this film four times now, and I must admit the first time I saw I wasn't a huge fan, but every time I've watched it since I've gotten more and more out of it. Stunning and amazing in many ways. A Kathryn Bigelow masterpiece.","135":"Great acting and incredible camerawork do not keep the nonexistant plot hidden. It was rather a series of American war propaganda-sketches then an actual movie. A very dissapointing mess, and it baffles me this won an oscar.","136":"This war movie is as real as it gets.","137":"Surprisingly quiet, yet captivating. Renner and Mackie was the heart of the film.","138":"Heart pounding and keeps you on edge, this film deserves it's praise","139":"Ahh yes that classic scene...American bomb disposal guys coming to the rescue of the SAS in the desert and showing them how to cope with a hostile sniper? What a total load of tosh! I really don't understand how this tripe made it to 97%.........","140":"Ce film (realise par une femme qui en a) nous teleporte dans la peau de desamorceurs de bombes en Iraq. C'est un huis-clos etouffant comme le desert, oppressant comme le scaphandre des techniciens, stressant comme l'imminence d'une explosion. Comme les soldats \"drogues\" a la guerre, l'adrenaline nous tient eveilles, on en oublie presque de cligner des yeux. La realite du conflit en Iraq nous explose a la figure: c'est une sale guerre, vicieuse, ou l'ennemi est partout et nulle part, une guerre sans but, ou les soldats, pour en sortir indemnes, doivent puiser en eux-memes des forces inconnues de la plupart des humains.","141":"I liked it, but for some reason I did not love it like everyone else.","142":"Decent, but extremely over rated.","143":"Good but crazy long movie... Or at least it felt like it.","144":"I'm sure have missed out on a lot of stuff.","145":"Can sum The Hurt Locker up in one phrase: Bullet-proof maverick bomb-defusing genius is addicted to war. A few nice performances (esp. Renner), occasional scenes suspenseful but only moderately so. Movie pulls its punches (the heroes don't get hurt much), reduces non-Yanks to ciphers (incompetent Brits, Iraqis mere pawns etc), treats the horror of war glibly. Hopelessly overrated and will date. Is actually a Hollywood movie esp wrt its sentimentality (even if funded 'independently'). The criticisms from Iraqi vets are revealing - better would have been a documentary feature. Such yarn-spinning cannot hold a candle to the real thing nor to a top-flight film.","146":"The Hurt Locker deals with a fairly unused topic: army engineers or bomb squads. It was more action packed then I expected with this type of movie, and was very suspenseful at times. I don't know why this movie is called on of the most unrealisic modern war movies, but I thought it to be fairly realistic, although it does show the main engineer as a overly courageous, heroic, badass soldier who preforms things that would never happen in the real military. Now I know a lot about the world wars, but I can't say I know to much about modern wars, but I would say this is a good military movie, although not perfect.","147":"Great movie, Provides some insight about combat engineers, one aspect of the military we don't see in most War movies.","148":"Originally, I thought that The Hurt Locker was a pretty generic and bland war movie. Upon a rewatch (this time at the behest of my friend, who has been butthurt over my dislike of it for six whole years), I still found it to be pretty bland,but nevertheless a much stronger film overall than I first thought. This movie definitely has the feel of a documentary, which is both its asset and its eventual downfall-- director Katherine Bigelow becomes so detached from the characters that she forgets to give them any emotional depth-- but the film is eventually salvaged by Jeremy Renner's career-making performance in the starring role and a story that is undeniably worth telling. It's not the Apocalypse Now of the Iraq War like some people are saying, but it's still not a bad movie.  The Hurt Locker stars Renner as a bomb defusal expert in Baghdad during the war in Iraq. During a couple of epic bomb defusal sequences, both of which showcase Renner's ability to be a friggin' badass without having to use a bow and arrow, he puts his squad in danger and takes unwarranted risks. However, Bigelow never goes too far, and always restricts his badassery to minor moments, like his cool and collected facial expressions while defusing a car bomb, or his ability to light up a cigarette after a near-death experience. The best part of his character is that, despite being a movie badass, he is still grounded in reality. No Live Free or Die Hard-style fighter jet sequences to be had here. However, the realism is undermined slightly by a scene in which one of the squad members (Anthony Mackie) suggests blowing Renner up in order to prevent the squad from being put in danger again. Okay, sure, we get that he's nervous about it. But forgive me if I don't see a military officer blowing up his commander. There's also a strangely surreal subplot in which Renner befriends a kid, finds his dead body, and then the kid comes back to life... or something... but fuck it. War is hell. We get it. Moving on.  The best part of The Hurt Locker is easily its story. Unlike other war films (cough cough Lone Survivor cough cough), it doesn't push a partisan agenda or force a message down the audience's throat. It just tells the story of what life is like day-to-day in occupied Baghdad. The first hour or so of the movie is actually quite great, showing individual days in extreme detail and sparing nothing. It starts out more like a serial adventure movie, actually, with a string of essentially unrelated bomb defusings, each more intense than the last. However, the problem with serials is that they have to end up having a unifying story throughout, and The Hurt Locker chooses an uninteresting subplot about Renner playing detective in downtown Baghdad as its way to hold the movie together. It's passable... but it could have been so, so much better.  The cinematography in this movie is (and I won't mince words here) shit. Sorry, but I've had enough of directors shaking their camera around at things and filming random stuff in slow-mo, pretending that it qualifies as an actual camera technique. Spoiler alert: It doesn't. The film does create some very good images (I know that the unwilling suicide bomber at the end of the movie will haunt me for some time), but at the end of the day, certain individual shots are more memorable than the movie as a whole. The slow-mo only really works once, when we see an IED go off at the very beginning of the film. After that, it just feels overused. And even when people are just talking, Bigelow shakes her camera around. Why? As the tension builds, she has nowhere to go. This not only holds back the nail-biting aspect of the movie, but the character development as well. Ugh, this movie could have been so much better.  Final Score for The Butthurt Locker: 6\/10 stars. I definitely liked it a lot more this second time around, but it's still nowhere near the cinematic Christ that it's been purported to be. Like most other Best Picture winners, I feel that this film will be forgotten soon, and other great films of 2008 (In Bruges, anyone?) will take its place. Still, it was going up against Avatarded and the war crime known as Up for Best Picture, so I'm not sorry it won. But it tries way too hard to be a character study without actually giving the audience any development for the characters. Hey, guys in the military miss their wives! Never seen that one before. Still though, the film is worth a viewing, and is infinitely superior to Bigelow's follow-up, Zero Dark Shitty, which sucks dick. It's good... but it's not great.","149":"This movie didn't wow me, maybe I'm just getting old. High-anxiety inducing? Nah- just don't get it- every US movie likes to portray all these screaming hysterical Arab women. Stereotypical. But I have to say, Mackie and Renner's performance were brilliant.","150":"Inaccurate. Might have liked it if the producers made even half an attempt to make it realistic.","151":"Watched yesterday. Good film with some great effects but didn't really understand the purpose of it...","152":"Deserved all of its success.","153":"I like that this is a movie about the war in Iraq that has very little political agenda... man I'm tired of everyone's opinion. This movie is about the job of being a soldier and really could be any modern war. Lots of suspense and some gut wrenching, heart breaking moments that really portray the reality, tragedy and horror of war. I like that the cast was relatively unknown (Ralph Fiennes really sticks out like \"oh shit whats Ralph Fiennes doing in Iraq?\") The movie is to the point and doesn't waste anytime getting you deep into grit. One last point, please enough with the shakey cam!!! it makes the experience nauseous and difficult to fully appreciate the movie.","154":"another Oscar's favourite. But I dont like this.","155":"The Hurt Locker is amazing direccted movie with strong performances from Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie.","156":"A bit long but most parts will surely be interesting to many. Overall, a good portrayal of a soldier's life in Iraq.","157":"the greatest Iraq war file so far","158":"One of the best war films of the last decade. Free from the cliche ridden storytelling, this one stands out from the rest and is guaranteed to give you an intense, suspenseful experience.","159":"Very good movie,Kathryn Bigelow as a director was fantastic, a big wow. Was very satisfied with the 6 awards. It's a very meaningful movie, it hits home close. Other than that Jeremy Renner was Fantastic.","160":"If Avatar wins over this, I will lose all faith in the academy.","161":"Suspense forming and intense action brings together some of the finest pieces of the art of war which makes this film so tense that you'll be clinging on the edge of your seat.","162":"Brilliant action war film","163":"Super intense movie. Renner played the role really well. Wasn't crazy about how it ended.","164":"The most basic of movies. I've watched this movie 3 times, trying to \"get it\", and I still don't understand its praise. I experience no thrill nor worry, and did not appreciate or feel concern for any of the characters when watching this film. Realism aside, The Hurt Locker is a simply crafted, overrated, unnecessary Oscar champion.","165":"It almost seems that since this is an issue that is still fresh in everyone's mind, people are actually afraid to give this movie a negative review, but the truth is, this film is not that deep, or that good. It's incredibly unrealistic, and I could get past that, but it goes beyond being unrealistic and at times appears downright disrespectful to people who have actually fought in Iraq. It portrays soldiers as a bunch of G.I. Joe wanna-be's that run around the theatre of war with no orders and seemingly no chain of command, just doing whatever they want whenever they want to.","166":"I normally despise war movies, especially those that unfurl in a post-9\/11 era, but this gripping war drama becomes a character study of traumatized heroes who have no sense of the word once they step foot into their domestic lives.","167":"Good and interesting story , they could maybe found one bomb less to keep the movie a bit shorter . Good acting by all ...a pitty Guy Pearce leaves the scene that quikly ! SOMDVD","168":"One of the most inaccurate military movies ever made....as any real combat vet will tell you. Whoever their military advisor was should be shot. Horrible.","169":"\"Countdown in Bravo Company's rotation: 39 days\" 2004. In post-invasion Baghdad, the streets are a maze of unseen dangers. Every indistinguishable inhabitant could be an insurgent and every discarded object could be a lethal bomb.An elite trio known as the EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal) unit has one mission; to find and neutralize IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) safely and without injury. Working in these knifes-edge jobs are subordinate techs Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge's (Brian Geraghty). The rationally methodical Sanborn values procedure and protocols whist the skittishly high-strung newbie Eldridge's only assignment is to protect.However, when Eldridge fails to pull the trigger, Team Leader Staff Sergeant Matt Thompson (Guy Pearce) meets a vaporizing demise by remote detonation and must be replaced for the remainder of the tour.Enter cool and cocky loose-cannon Staff Sergeant (SSG) William James (Jeremy Renner). Filling Thompson's inherited shoes is not James intention, his entirely indifferent attitude to the situation makes him quite and enigma to his new comrades. The hotter the situation, the cooler he becomes.When the team is called to the scene of a suspicious abandoned car, SSG James slowly follows the red wires but refuses to follow the rules. To the displeasure of Sergeant Sanborn, James strips off his astronaut style protective Kevlar suit to be more comfortable and removes his headset obscuring communication leaving his team to support him blind. As one tense situation is resolved; another begins.Fueling the dissention forming in the ranks, Sanborn and Eldridge battle with the question; Does their reckless \"red-neck trailer-trash\" leader have a death wish or is he simply that good? Can James forge team camaraderie and get them through the remainder of the tour alive?Departing from the modern gung-ho American clich\u00e9s of glamorized war movies, this stark adrenaline filled film doesn't explain whether war is just or necessary nor does it attempt to give reason to impenetrable geopolitics of the Middle East. It is just content to be deeply grounded in the language of humanity and mans inner turmoil under severe pressure in extraordinary circumstances.Deserving of its Avatar matching nine Oscar nominations, The Hurt Locker is wonderful scripted by first-hand-experienced screenwriter and journalist Mark Boal, beautifully shot utilizing hand-held cameras, grainy textures and washed out colourings and superbly, effortlessly and searing acting by a cast of obscure and relatively unknown actors.As The Times eloquently states this is a \"near perfect movie\" owed in large part to its female director Kathryn Bigelow. The supremely masculine story clearly benefits from Bigelow's feminine touch. Excusing the testosterone fueled explosions of most films in its topic favoring a more slow burn action. The timely introduction of black humor and snorting satire and its delicately handed exploration of the raw male psyche opens the gripping window into its nerve-shattering world. The films flaws are minor. A cohesive string tying the harrowing moments together is missing and the films path is unsatisfying unfocused. Three scenes in particular; an unrequited redemption, a superficial explanation and a trite death, are out-of-kilter and feel unconnected to the overall tone. The Verdict: It has been said \"War is a drug .. A force that gives us meaning\". This film grabs viewers by the scruff-of-the-neck and drags them through the layers and dimensions of war. Meticulously authentic, the white-knuckle action consummately embodies the throbbing anxiety, paranoia and dread of its terrifying cat-and-mouse subject.Published: The Queanbeyan AgeDate of Publication: 26\/02\/2010","170":"This film does a great job of building tension and highlighting the hells of the Iraq War, for both the soldiers and the locals.","171":"Intense and eye opening....Great War movie","172":"This film master's the art of tension.","173":"Is The Hurt Locker a well made film on every account: yes! But is it my cup of tea: no. Take that with a grain of salt and call it what you want but its simply a well made film that isn't my thing.","174":"Before The Hurt Locker came out, Kathryn Bigelow wasn't that much famous of a director, and the films that she was well known for were After Dark and Break Point. So she teams up with writer Mark Boal to create this which is the best soldier film that takes place in the Iraq War. Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty give out some fantastic performances that bring out a spark to this movie. The characters are very memorable and they felt like real people. The writing by Mark Boal is well written and it sounds realistic to what the characters are saying. The action is really good and is very realistic from what the soldiers do to get out of the situation. The plot is really good, and it has some tense moments. The movie shows how much it can change a soldier that they either want to go home to their family, or stay in the war because not many people can do it. The Hurt Locker is nothing like I've see before like other soldier films and it's nice to see that Hollywood can make original films at times.","175":"A well directed realistic war film with a great performance from Jeremy Renner.","176":"The best Iraq War movie made to date boasting a great cast and even better direction, this is tough look into the lives of EOD units disposing of bombs in Baghdad. Jeremy Renner is outstanding. Essential viewing people.","177":"A well- acted intensely shot action filled war epic kathryn bigelow's the hurt locker is thus far the best of the recent dramatizatons of the iraq war","178":"Probably the best Iraq War ever","179":"It had some affecting moments (especially the scenes back in the US), but otherwise very underwhelming.","180":"Finally got to see it. Exceptional look at what life might well look like for the US bomb squads in Iraq. Intense, personal and real. Worth your 2 hour investment.","181":"Easily one of the best war movies I have ever seen. I'm normally not a fan of this genre (with a few exceptions), but The Hurt Locker never manages to turn the viewer off with endless depictions of guts and carnage merely thrown in there for the satisfaction of its bloodthirsty teenage audience. Rather, it is a smart, expertly paced thriller that builds suspense through clever writing, rich characterization, and haunting themes of sanity and motivation during times of war. This is one of those rare films that stays riveting despite its slow pacing.","182":"very interesting!!!! you can get right into it, nice directing and producing!","183":"Raw and one of the most authentic war films.","184":"Above all the non-stop suspense, even the camera works help describing how the main character's feel.","185":"Stunning! You'll be blown away.","186":"great film about bomb disposal in Iraq lots of tension and surprise cameos from famous actors (ralph fiennes in particular). the main and mostly unknown stars do a great job of portraying the dangerous job they do and the dangers they face whilst coming to the end of their tour. how do they react back home in civillian life?","187":"wow I loved this movie, it was ace, I would love to see this film again and have it on DVD, it starred Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse and Evangeline Lilly it was a great film and it ws directed by Kathryn Bigelow","188":"As tense as it gets. Deserving of the its' Best Picture award.","189":"Couldn't get past the first 45 min. EOD specialists taking stupid risks and portraying the real soldiers as John Wayne idiots.","190":"A very 2 dimensional film. Out of all the actual decent films that came out the year this thing was released.... Nothing made me care about the characters or the story. There was nothing that stood out as intelligent or meaningful. For a film so highly praised by audiences and critics I find myself so very disappointed.","191":"PlotThe plot of The Hurt Locker is very original. The plot follows the last thirty days of a bomb squad rotation in Iraq. Through out the last days the team is caught up in fire fights, IED's and two replacements. There is no real enemy - yes there are the terrorist - but the enemy is really the emotion of the soldiers and their conflicts. There's a few surprises which always include the suspenseful IED moments.Awards WonThe Hurt Locker also won the 2008 Best Picture Oscar Award. I think that the award was justified. The Hurt Locker has amazing sound and editing as well as the plot with a story most people didn't even knew that existed.ThemesI think there is no overall theme to the movie but, it does lead an impression on the viewer. That impression is the hatred of terrorist, the movie is very emotional especially the IED scenes. The director does a great job showing this throughout the music and the people that were harmed or killed.Technical ElementsI think that the movie has amazing audio. Whether it is the breathing of the soldiers, or the amazing music that is so suspenseful. The audio is very cool as well as the battle scenes. In those scenes the lens is dirty and slightly out of focus which I like adding to suspense. I thought the movie was very well edited.ConclusionOverall I thought The Hurt Locker was a great very well edited war drama. I think this would be a great movie night movie.-AS, 8th Grade Student","192":"Despite its critical acclaim I wasn't blown away hahahahhahaha","193":"A movie with no real plot or storyline that moves the movie along.","194":"Kathryn Bigelow is such a good filmmaker I'm surprised she isn't a man.","195":"The best film that I've seen in ages! The hurt locker offers excitement all the way through and shows the real actions so the people who serve out there.","196":"The \"Platoon\" and \"The Thin Red Line\" for this generation. Jeremy Renner gives a star breaking performance along with Anthony Mackie as well. Great cameos from Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes. Kathryn Bigelow deserves most of the credit for this movie as this is her movie as she is in full command of it","197":"The \"Platoon\" and \"The Thin Red Line\" for this generation.

Our 2000s generation has The Hurt Locker. The entire movie is made up of a series of vignettes, each a variation of the same study of an experience as an American soldier in Iraq. A lot of things happen, but almost in repetition- a soldier walks the fine line between life and death, but the life is also intensively mundane at the same time.","199":"Phenomenal movie, VERY suspenseful. A lot of the scenes were very emotional and it left me wanting more.","200":"\"The Hurt Locker\" is a movie from 2009.It was nominated for the 82nd Academy Award and won in six different categories.Katheryn Bigelow, who was the supervisior of this movie, won the academy Directing Award.She has made splendid movies in various fields such as action or horror, and she is a first woman to ever win an Academy award for directing.\"Hurt Locker\", the title of this movie, is U. S. Military slang.It means \"an extreme zone of the pain\".\"The war is a drug\"This sentence, spoken in the beginning of the movie, describes the life of James who is the main character.James goes to the battle front as a member of Special Forces and of the U. S. Military bomb squad.He goes to there and handles a very dangerous mission and returns home where his wife and child live.However, he does not calm down even when he is in the house.The war is a drug for him.It is essential for him and is his life itself.And, war still existed somewhere in the world.The person obsessed with war like James will continue existing as long as there is war.According to a third party, you may think all matters about war nonsensically.However, it is fact that there are the people who find a way of life and continue to chase it, just like he does.For them, the battle front is their HOME.If person like James loses his HOME, what would happen?This movie has a big concept for us to think about - the existence of war.","201":"A good movie that got really overhyped, however the bits that are good are really good. B+","202":"well-deserved oscar movie.","203":"Lot more realistic than other war movies.","204":"An authentic, tense, and immediate appraisal of the personal costs of war, the humanity of the soldier, and the experience of combat. A near perfect film which relays the brutal truth and the personal conviction of military imperialism equally.","205":"Pretty awesome movie! Great job @ helping those who've never served in our military an idea of what is sacrificed for our freedom & the lengths at which we will go to keep it!","206":"Wasn't that excited about this movie","207":"It's like watching real war footage, with no story behind it.","208":"Gripping movie. What is life after you've seen death.","209":"Very gripping story and emotionally charged.","210":"Definitely a good movie and it was actually funny at some points; but I just can't relate to anyone who would want to disarm bombs for a living sooo definitely not the Best Picture of 2009 for me.","211":"I thought this movie was good, but not as good as all the hype says it is. It had good acting and a suspenseful story however there's one part within the last 40 minutes that I find ridiculous to be in a war movie.","212":"I never thought that servicemen were selfish until I saw this movie","213":"Overrated, but very intense and entertaining. This movie won Best Picture in '09, and I don't know if it truly deserved it. The writing is great at times, forced at others. The directing is well done, despite the cinematography being extremely shaky and close up. I felt like I was watching Lost at a point due to the close up shaky feel of the camerawork. The acting is phenomenal though, and while certain things happen that aren't believable, they are overrun by the incredibly intense bomb and sniper scenes. Honestly, while I prefer Zero Dark Thirty, Bigelow's war drama is a very captivating movie that is worth at least one watch. 8.25\/10","214":"I am not a fan of war films, yet The Hurt Locker has a very up-close and raw description of the Iraq War. I am amazed at Jeremy Renner's performance and the development his character achives by the end of the film. The cinematography paints a ghostly and silent scenario swiftly disrupted by explosions. It truly deserves its Oscar for Best Picture.","215":"\u00c9 legalzinho, mas n\u00e3o entendi o au\u00ea com esse filme.","216":"Mildly interesting. It didn't \"hurt\" to watch.","217":"I liked it better the zero dark thirty in my opinion.","218":"Superb - proper war macho without the Michael Bay factor. The perfect thesis of how war is like a drug - a mixture of excitement, adrenaline and bullish highs, you'll even start to believe the doc - that war \"...doesn't have to be a bad time in your life. Going to war is a once in a lifetime experience! It could be fun.\" But as we know, with highs come the deprivating lows... The film refuses to fall on one side or the other on the morality of war, instead concentrating on depicting modern warfare as immersively as possible. Gripping stuff.","219":"Not a bad movie. Just not great either.","220":"Wow. Really not worth any Oscars at all. 160 minutes I'll never get back.","221":"Jeremy Renner is perfect in this and Bigelow shines as director, but best picture of the year? Not for me.","222":"It didn't exactly blow me away..To much buzz and oscars but the movie was just ok..My expectations were high but this is not the best movie of 2008..","223":"The reasons why this is a \"Academy Award\" picture are lost on me.","224":"It hurt so bad to see a good looking and anticipated war film such as The Hurt Locker put to waste the way it did","225":"Excellent. Apart from being an unbelievably good action movie, it's notable as a detailed psychological study and actors' showcase. Go see this.","226":"Great movie, but from what I remember, I wasn't a huge fan.","227":"The conflicts each character has with himself are greater than the conflicts of war. That's what separates this movie from the rest, and that's what makes it so great. Also, it's really unpredictable, with a high sense of tension at all times. You can get a close look at what the characters feel, through incredible performances by their actors, specially Reener and Geraghty.","228":"\"The rush of battle is a potent and often lethal addiction, for war is a drug\", just breath, because maybe this will be the most exciting and realistic experience that you can have watching a movie about the Iraq War.The Hurt Locker is extraordinary from A to Z, this original story by Mark Boal follows a group of soldiers from the U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal in Iraq and their problems and feelings during his stay in that country. Doesn't sound like a brilliant script, but believe me it is, and also is very original.The film focuses on three main soldiers, the brave bastard Sgt. William James played by the great Jeremy Renner, the polite Sgt. J.T. Sanborn played by Anthony Mackie and the insecure one Specialist Owen Eldridge played by Brian Geraghty. All they are awesome, but Renner and Mackie were the ones who introduced me to the emotions of a real fighter.One day women will be good cinema directors said someone once, that day is here and the name of the director is Kathryn Bigelow, how talented is she.The technical achievement are impressive, the cinematography of Barry Ackroyd is truely beautiful, the sound by Paul N. J. Ottosson and Ray Beckett is wonderfull like the edition of Chris Innis and Bob Murawski, but don't ask me about the score made by Marco Beltrami because was difficult can hear it clearly.Well, the best picture of 2009, some people said that was near- perfect, but i I would dare say that is perfect. Without doubts is advisable to a hundred percent and personally is one of the best cinematic experiences of my life.","229":"Perhaps rather overrated, but I have seen worst choices deemed as Oscar-worthy. The tale is gripping and down-to-earth enough to be convincing as a semi-documentary, first hand experience","230":"Very poor for a war film. The \"intense\" scenes got boring very quickly, and the elements of the story wasn't that realistic.","231":"just not that good or interesting","232":"A different kind of war movie in all the right ways.","233":"el tipo esta algarete!","234":"\"The Hurt Locker\" was the winner of Best Picture in the 2010 Academy Awards and Kathryn Bigelow won for Best Director as well and although it may have been a controversial win (What aren't?) it was an overall solid film. The film focuses on troops in the Middle East and their constant struggle with day to day life and specifically focuses on a group of bomb technicians who put their lives at risk daily to save fellow soldiers. All the actors here give great performances and the film is wonderfully captured and stunning to view in motion which all add up to a great film. In my opinion I think it deserved the win when compared to what else was up for the award and you have to see it in order to really grasp that!","235":"Renner in this is perfect","236":"Without a doubt, one of the most brilliant war movies ever made.","237":"What an amazing film. We sat down testing the disc, and couldn't leave until the credits rolled.","238":"Well-acted and perfectly directed war film\/drama that makes you think. The shaky camera work will turn some people off but I did not find it bothersome. The scenes of bomb-work are intense and filled with suspense. The emotion is real and Jeremy Renner is a great casting choice for the lead. Very deserving of all of the hype, although the Oscar for Best Picture seems a bit unwarranted. It was a great movie but not the best of the year. A must-see for fans of war films, drama, and suspense thrillers.","239":"one intense scene followed by another! Great movie....","240":"Didn't strike me as anywhere near a classic, although it's still a worthwhile movie.","241":"The Hurt Locker is well suited by its more subtle approach to the effects war has on individuals. This makes for the most suspense driven war film I've ever seen. The performances, particularly from Jeremy Renner, make for an inscrutably complicated cinema experience.","242":"Don't really like war film because the suffering its visualize, although it's always thrilling to watch this kind of movie. :p I don't like to think that Islam is used as a political weapon while i kinda agree about it this past few days as my dad says it and what i saw on newspaper\/tv and now this movie. hadeeuuhh berattt... Jeremy Renner is sexy here though..hehehe Great movie btw :)","243":"The Hurt Locker is a fantastic film. It is about an elite Army bomb squad unit must come together in a city where everyone is a potential enemy and every object could be a deadly bomb. Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie give amazing performances. The script is well written with plenty of thrills. Kathryn Bigelow did a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the drama. The Hurt Locker is a must see.","244":"best movie from Jeremy Renner masterpiece right here","245":"Just one of those movies that makes you see modern war in a up to date light; just good acting and realism interest.","246":"There's a scene where a soldier asks \"What are we firing at?\" and the other soldier says \"I don't know\". And that kinda sums up how I feel about this movie. What's the point of another generic Iraq War movie? I don't know. This movie literally brings nothing new and interesting to the table in a genre where you could toss out about 90% of it's entries and still not be missing much. The worst part is that despite it's desperate attempt to be a gritty realistic war movie, it fails to even be slightly believable. There's absolutely nothing to care about, not the paper thin plot, not the stock soldier characters and definitely not fact that it's yet another \"hurr durr war is bad did you know people die in wars\" movie.","247":"It's supremely well done, but it's emotionally distant, due in large part to cookie cutter characters and anti-climactic war action.","248":"This is very much Jeremy Renner's film, and whilst there's not that much of a story, the set-pieces are exciting and the relationship between the main three characters interesting. I liked how 'big' name actors kind of dropped in, and were quickly done away with (one way or another), leaving it up to Hawkeye to be the main focus.","249":"I may upset many people by saying this, but I believe this film to be one of the most over-rated movies of all time. Let's start off by clearing one thing up - I am not at all saying this is a bad movie, it's nicely directed, powerfully acted, with a decent and realistic use of special effects which do not completely dominate screen presence. It does give a strong representation of the Iraq war, yet throughout the film I found myself detatched. It never absorbed me deep enough to overcome some of its drawn out scenes, it was almost like what was there was a good basis, yet there was not enough emotion, tension, or gritty reality to keep me enthralled. It is certainly not a bad war film, but I have seen a wealth of better ones. And I must say, when comparing this to Cameron's Avatar, this robbed that film of its well-deserved Oscars.","250":"If you've read my review of Close Encounters, you know how I feel about husbands\/fathers abandoning their families. I suppose that there are people out there like Renner's character, but that doesn't mean that I want to watch their story. it's also way too long. I find it shocking that it won best picture at the Oscars.","251":"Skillfully walking the tightrope to avoid inserting a bias, The Hurt Locker is an infinitely relevant film to today's world that captures the experience of the war on terror more effectively than ever before, offering enough character analysis to match the chaotic setting.","252":"A movie thats strictly speaks of the hardship of lives of the men that go to a WAR representing their nation, in particular, as presented in this movie, the war on terror and how terrorism get often ruin the average normal lives we lead...no over-dramatisation, this movie is very much PERFECT and one of those that just doesnt follow a typical ending","253":"Great movie! Loved every bit of it.","254":"Intense and fantastic. Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie are great as part of an elite bomb squad in Iraq that is under extreme pressure everyday to dismantle IEDs while dodging enemy fire. I always think a great movie should invoke some sort of strong feelings and this one made me so angry(enraged) and sad. Really well done and definitely Best Picture material.","255":"I saw the edited version of it on TV this morning :-)","256":"Surprisingly, I'd never seen it. Not quite sure it matched the hype, but it was still pretty damn good.","257":"Very realistic war movie-you can really get inside the characters heads and feel the tension caused by anyone can be an enemy. Well-acted and a lot of intense war moments from bomb dismantling to snipers. It was a sad movie and well done. The things I didn't like was annoying shaky camera sometimes, no background on some of soldiers, and disjointed plot Because of it's documentary style.","258":"One of the best war movies EVER","259":"Im not saying I agree that it won best picture over avatar, but I can see why. I don't understand some people's remarks. One guy says it's unrealistic bc the protocol for defusing the bombs wasn't correct. Since when did this movie say it was real or a documentary. Cause I read it was fictional in its own description. Lol. Avatar and this movie ate not comparable bc the genres are completely different. I saw another comment where the person didn't know what the point of the movie was. How about... That war fucking sucks ass. Or how about these men and women lay everything on the line for us. Or also that even though Americans are fighting the Taliban they often make friendships and care for iraqis. I thought it was great.","260":"brilliant film, loved every minute of it, full of action.","261":"A really good War movie that had great acting and direction. Although it wasn't nearly as good as Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down, I think it was easily the next best thing. Visually stunning and the story was great and thrilling!","262":"A contemplative war film that offers one edge-of-your-seat action sequence after another, with a bit of food for thought when it's all over.","263":"I'm a sucker for a good war movie and this is not just a good war movie it's a brilliant war movie,although the last 21 to 32 minutes I think didn't make sense nor do I think did it fit in the story. This is most charismatic and the strongest performance I've seen from Jeremy Renner. Anthony Mackie's performance is strong too.","264":"I can't even begin to describe my hatred for this movie. And yet I can sum it up in one word: Idiotic. It's so full of stupid and didn't even entertain me. I felt that Jeremy Renner's character was a moron who somehow made it in and out of bootcamp and his foolishness remained unscathed. There was a scene where he was disarming a bomb in a car and when his team told him to get out of the car so that they could regroup he chose to stay and disarm the bomb for no reason other than, as the movie says, for the adrenaline rush. That's right. He chose to risk his life for no other reason other than an adrenaline rush. I know that this movie was trying to say that \"war is a drug\" and to that I say BULLSHIT! War may be a part of what a soldier is, but war is not a drug. War is HELL. Those who want to go to war have never truly been there before. One other thing I hate about this movie is that it makes out war to be filled with all this action (which wasn't even entertaining) and that the military is filled with incompetent morons who don't even know how to take a simple order of staying alive. Seriously Jarhead was more entertaining than this trash. Jarhead didn't even have a single action scene,The soldiers were more intelligent and IT WAS BELIEVABLE! Avoid this movie.","265":"This is a strong charecter driven film focusing on the Soldiers` life's in the Army rather than an all out action War film.","266":"I felt it left more to be desired.","267":"The best movie about the war in Iraq, this movie is very suspenseful and realistic. Great acting and phenomenal direction.","268":"Great rush from beginning to end.","269":"It was ok. Not great.","270":"Although it lacked a little bit on background knowledge, The Hurt Locker is a fantastic movie.","271":"This movie was pretty amazing, loved it.","272":"The Hurt Locker is Kathryn Bigelow's essay into comparing the addiction to war to the addiction to drugs. Jeremy Renner portrays a rogue IED dismantler and his by the book crew. Based upon the personal accounts of journalist Mark Boal during the Iraq War Bigelow provides a gritty and grim vision of what it's truly like to be a soldier in today's world. Renner, Omari Hardwick, and Brian Geraghty lead the EOD crew and we see their day-to-day encounters with IEDS complete with destruction and death. Emotions and tensions run high throughout and the conclusion leaves us wondering what will become of the characters that we became so familiar with. A gripping expose on the horrors of war.","273":"10 out of 10:Gripping, well directed, amazing acting, and very gut wrenching, The Hurt Locker remains a war movie classic.","274":"This is Brilliant! This is best Kathryn Bigelow films. Who lost Detroit.","275":"Intense and powerful film about the Iraq War. Strong performances from its leads make this movie about an EOD team in the Iraq war. I loved the dynamic of the different personalities and how the interacted with each other during the intensity of war.","276":"An intimate and multilayered portrayal of the tense, emotionally-riveting journey of a group of bomb-defusers during the Iraq War. The film shows the polarized reactions of different people during times of adrenaline-fueled crises.","277":"Exceptional and patriotic. Even though many argue it is unrealistic, is hard to know for sure unless you have been too war!","278":"Literally puts you in the shoes of a bomb disposal expert and makes you breath just as heavy at what is about to happen next just as you would be in a juggernaut suit. Great directing!","279":"Real solid flick all around","280":"I wasn't really a huge fan of this movie. I didn't enjoy it and personally thought it was a really boring movie.","281":"A good gritty look at modern warfare that imparts a few important messages. It doesn't however do a good job of filling its runtime and ends up dragging on a bit too long with some confusing story arcs and cliche scenes.","282":"Overall The Hurt Locker is a very powerful film with characters portraying differing opinions of war-life with beautifully shot scenes and intense bomb scenarios.","283":"Best movie of 2009. Easily.","284":"It has an awful first half where it does not explain a thing and you are left with many questions, but it actually starts to explain things later and all the characters get more depth. Unfortunately, when that finally happens it is too late and it also feels kinda forced. Not to mention the problematic message the movie conveys at the end. Overall, a mediocre film which is mysteriously incredibly overrated.","285":"How have I never seen this. Great film. Makes you think too","286":"One of my favorite war movies. Well acted.","287":"''The best action film ever made; Suspense that won't quite.'' The Editing was electrifying for an action film, shot after shot after shot............","288":"This movie was recommended to me with statement of an instant classic however I wasn't too impressed with not only the main character who other than him being an American I cod honestly have given two shits whether he was blown up or not. This was not a true story it was however based on true events, in other words it was Hollywoodified,(nice made up word) plus it was directed by some hoe who I'm sure has no clue of reality in WAR. Classic? I think not, a good one time view? Nah. Let it go without another thought...","289":"A relentlessly terrifying experience that's more than the sum of the shots fired or the bombs disarmed, Director Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is a picture that's true to the horrors of War -- particularly the psychological anguish incurred even in place of physical harm -- and not the run-and-gun action normally associated with lesser-in-meaning War movies. With a strong cast; exceptional direction and cinematography; and a moving, often gut-wrenching thematic overtone that analyzes the fragility of the human condition through the prism of the uncertainty of war, The Hurt Locker sets a new standard for genre excellence and has solidified itself as a contemporary War movie classic.","290":"a good movie. i think they could have done better","291":"Kathryn Bigelow bet, created a masterpiece of war. really is a film full of feelings, Misfortune, Guilt and anxiety really is a film that gives much to think and there is what drives his perfection.","292":"Kathryn Bigelow's absolutely deserved her Academy Award for Best Director. The Hurt Locker isn't your ordinary war epic, its a destructive epic that successfully grips you into the explosive suspense where everything involving explosives unfolds as if the Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team are walking on invisible mines as it successfully captivates you into it's impressively directed depiction of the Iraq War - Especially because of Jeremy Renner's performance. ~8.5\/10","293":"Like the way it was done and the way the cast did it. Enjoyed the overall look with nice action and drama scenes.","294":"Great plot and the best shaky camera editing since The Bourne Ultimatum. Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie are spot on as well","295":"This is the movie that beat out Avatar...Cameron's ex-wife directed this one. That got me curious but not enough to put it on my priority list. Well, The Hurt Locker putting a hurting on me...It was two hours too long. It was decent enough, but this is just not my type of movie...Seeing as to how I was actually over there before I finally retired and they were threatening to send my team back. So yeah, I got it but it was just to close to home.","296":"Exhaustingly intense. love it","297":"One of those movies that is awesome from start to finish but doesn't leave you with many memories at the end","298":"2nd best war movie i've ever seen.","299":"Amazingly suspenseful war drama from Kathryn Bigelow (justified by her Oscar win). It's a bit of a downer, but the performances, especially from Jeremy Renner & the ever-increasing tension brought on by what the troops in Iraq & Afghanistan have to go through every day is absolutely nail-biting. A brilliant film.","300":"Reed: Whats the best way to go about disarming one of these things?Sergent James: They way you don't die sir.This movie was exhilarating. Tons of action with scenes so thick with suspense you can almost taste it. The story was also quite moving. Friends dead in the blink of an eye, family waiting, worrying. It was quite an epic film.And how in the hell did they get Evangeline Lilly? lol, that was probably the biggest surprise.Incredible film, go watch it [Buy, Download as its out of theaters atm.]Would of gotten a 5\/5 from me, but I docked a star for the extremely loose usage of foul language. It may be realistic, but it sure as heck ain't family friendly. Its Hollywood... nothing they release is realistic, so for once, sacrifice the language to keep it family friendly...","301":"A well-acted and intense war film, but hurt by the plot being more like a series of missions than an actual story. Not to mention that some of the decisions made by the soldiers seem unrealistic and unnecessary. Despite these flaws and a somewhat anti-climatic ending, it's still a solid film.","302":"It was nice to see the unconventional Super 16 format in a theatrical release especially early on in the film's development. However the overuse of snap zooms, non relative quick cuts, and Kathryn Bigelow's usual creation of linear, one dimensional and blandish characters complete with a predictable plot just doesn't quite make \"Best Picture\" quality","303":"we need MORE movie like this!","304":"An epically awesome thrill-ride from start to finish, \"The Hurt Locker\" puts all the more recent action films to shame, thanks to its gritty camerawork, practical design, a strong emphasis on character development, intense performance from Jeremy Renner, and its raw depiction of war.","305":"nice war movi..diff prospective","306":"Well...I really did WANT to like The Hurt Locker, but it's a bit too patriotic and righteous about the war for me (at least that's what I see in it), and tries to be a modern Saving Private Ryan...and fails. It's entertaining enough, no doubt about that, and the actors are doing a good job, but...a lot of it is kinda generic.","307":"This is the most realistic representation of (modern) war that has ever been portrayed in film (Probably as realistic as we want it to get too). The direction is flawless the characters are real and gritty, the story stays with you and the visuals refuse to leave you alone. A truly marvelous movie from Kathryn Bigelow. Jeremy Renner's best performance to date.","308":"Intense, dark, and very much realistic war EPIC! The movie is the definition of good war movie. Acting was brilliant, no scene is wasted. Brilliant brilliant brilliant","309":"Weighed down by a bloated story that meanders too often and a cast of supporting characters who fail to be interesting, Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is nonetheless an intense, well-crafted war epic, terrifically and tautly rendered and showcasing a masterfully gripping lead performance from Jeremy Renner as Sergeant James. It may also feature one of modern cinema's best endings.","310":"Still dont have any idea if there was a plot.","311":"Good film full of drama and intense action. Very well done.","312":"Most of the bomb scenes were incredibly interesting but the in-between stuff was an issue. The film was a little too abstract in its overall message to be effective.","313":"You may find yourself holding your breath quite a lot as the tension builds and the anticipation snails across the screen. As you watch the Americans and Iraqis die the realism is brought to the fore, with the harsh characters and empty headed brain washing taking centre stage. World War II films are much more fun. American snipers came across as rather pathetic in the first instance. Nibbles: Banana Cake.","314":"Excellent film set in Iraq. Bigelow won an Oscar for her outstanding direction, becoming the first woman to win as Best Director and it is well deserved. Jeremy Renner is great here!","315":"Better than I thought it would be, love Guy and Jeremy!","316":"The good reviews to this film and its story and action make it interesting. To see if you meet it.","317":"How all movies should be made. Gritty and real, cannot wait for Zero Dark Thirty.","318":"It's not perfect, but its worth watching. Jeremy Renner is a freak.","319":"This isn't saying much, but \"The Hurt Locker\" is the best movie about the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Ably filmed by director Kathryn Bigelow and insightfully scripted by Mark Boal, it effectively captures the harsh lifestyle that American soldiers endured during their rotations as well the constant fear that death was waiting right around the corner for them. It's tense and exceptionally well-made, containing several unforgettable instances of masterful editing and camerawork. \"The Hurt Locker\" is also a lot more understated than I had originally anticipated, opting to focus more on its characters and their situations rather than its plotting. Because of this human element, we become more involved in the action and curious about the fates of the characters, but it's also kind of noticeable that not much happens in the course of two hours.","320":"Behold the modern warfare movie. Extremely well-executed suspense. A nerve-wrecking sniper fight, a thrilling \"hostage with a collar bomb\" situation, are some of the sequences that will keep you at the edge of your seat.","321":"a defining film about the addiction our country seems to have with armed conflict.","322":"Propelled by Kathryn Bigelow flawless direction and Jeremy Renner brilliant performance, The Hurt Locker is a vivid (if quiet propagandistic) portrait of war as an addiction with a beautiful cinematography and a very appropiate dirty atmosphere.","323":"One of the best I've seen. Writing this makes me want to see it again!","324":"Love it, every single second after Jeremy Renner, appears.","325":"This is a hell of a movie. The performances are so well done. The directing by Kathryn Bigelow is so powerful. \"One of the best movies of 2008.\" Great screenplay. Excellent special effects and score. This movie is a MUST SEE!!!!","326":"Jeremy Rener is great in this movie. Another intense film from KB.","327":"Intensely dramatic yet so realistic.The Hurt Locker serves up a different feel of the conflit in the Middle East. We all know that constant shooting,dying and more shooting can become very mundane. So this film successfully avoided it.With its intense and gripping storyline and the cast's powerful acting,this is a must watch for movie-goers who loves well written drama.","328":"The best film of 2009","329":"The Hurt Locker is pretty good. The visuals were stunning and the war was real. On the other hand, the script at several times was so blah and weak it made you cringe. The characters were good and the acting was good but The Hurt Locker seemed to be more about the war itself than its warriors. I don't think this deserved movie of the year.","330":"still an excellent afghan war film which hollywood should do more of set in iraq or afghanistan the 3 main leads are superb  a amazing war film with a perfect plot and great tense scenes","331":"This is what a war movie must be. War it's not just people shooting to other people, this movie is a perfect transposition of psychological violence you feel in a conflict. Direction is superb. Breathtaking photography.","332":"The defining film of the Iraq war.","333":"A dire\u00e7\u00e3o de Kathryn Bigelow \u00e9 simplesmente impec\u00e1vel. E ainda tira o m\u00e1ximo de seu elenco nesse protesto contra a guerra.","334":"Dull and overrated war story about a journalist's time in Iraq with a bomb squad. Oscars only mistake in the history of the awards. Gran Torino was a better film than this messy pic.","335":"One of the many great war movies to always be remembered.","336":"An incredibly acted war drama that will open your eyes to the reality of war in the Middle East. From an incredible script to the gripping action, this film just might make you emotionally invested.","337":"Say hello to the most overrated movie of all time. This is a movie that got so much buzz because of the circumstances we were living in at the time, and with good reason. The movie has some well-made scenes, but unfortunately, the majority of the movie is just a poorly directed character arc, that doesn't work for me at all. Jeremy Renner was never my favorite actor, even though I enjoy to watch him in movies. However, I thought that his performance in this movie was sloppy and incredibly unbelievable. Kathryn Bigelow is one of the best female directors that we have, and she does a good job with the movie, but I don't know if it was Oscar-worthy. The movie is surely time for some people who like war-movies, but to me, it just didn't work.","338":"Filled with tension and gripping drama, Kathryn Bigelow masterfully directed a compelling and action-packed Iraq War drama that is far better than American Sniper, thanks to two great performances from Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie.","339":"The Hurt Locker (2009) ??? 1\/2Extraordinarily intense examination of an army bomb squad in Iraq, forced to do what frightens even them: scan every (and any) possible area where an explosive may be hidden. Difficult drama told with excruciating suspense, film is actually tough to watch at certain parts. Jeremy Renner gives a heartfelt, unconventional performance in episodic but spellbinding movie, winner of 6 Oscars for Picture, Direction, Script, others.","340":"\"War is a drug\"Bigelow gives us a intense view in the war of Iraq. I believe the war in Iraq is just a medium to really convey different aspects of a soldier in war especially that of the character of Jeremy Renner. The Iraq War is depicted well and honestly. Furthermore the action and terrain is shot stupendously. The soldiers thoughts are in conflict and conveyed really well. Meticulous, engaging, and original \"The Hurt Locker\" is a powerful film that can be translated to many people in different powerful ways.","341":"Awesome movie, Jeremy Renner is fantastic, he should have won awards for it.","342":"I was briefly in the army I'm a chick's chick had no place being there but respect the (mostly) men who are there war is he-l-l...","343":"Interesting, and has potential for being an exciting war movie. However, it cant keep up to its promise. The excitement blands down pretty soon, and the overly long duration film becomes tedious when it should keep its pace and go on. Violence, people blown up, some bombs being discovered, people getting shot.. I don't know really, why this film was rated so high. Its well acted, it is solid in its storytelling, its probably realistic too.. (I would not know, I have never been to war) but its not enough. It is also repetitive, simplistic and rather disgusting. The story allows the characters to develop, but they do not. The interesting exciting things do not grow. Just before ripening, the fruit is eaten by a big worm of laziness. The film is is lazy.","344":"Did it deserve to take home the award of Best Picture? No. Is it worth a watch, still? Definitely.","345":"I need to see this again with a different mindset. I didn't really understand it or like it the first time.","346":"Best cinematography I have ever witnessed in a movie! This movie was truly a piece of art. Hats off to you Kathryn Bigelow.","347":"Beautifully directed by Bigelow, and acted to near incredibility, The Hurt Locker had me mesmerized from the opening frame.","348":"Overrated to say the least, The Hurt Locker launched Jeremy Renner into stardom... and to this day, I have no idea why. The film tries to justify his character by not only making him a rogue-ish bomb dismantler, but also needing to have a character outright say that he is a \"wildman\" in a complimentary way, as if the audience didn't already get that idea after the first 45 minutes into the film. His character just seemed like an uninteresting jerk the whole way through (other than the fact that he dismantles bombs and is good at it, we get it). There is also a scene where he fights his fellow compatriots, wrestling them to the ground with his bare hands for no apparent reason other than to establish his character as a rebel. He's a smug jagoff that likes getting himself into terrible situations because he simply can't live without being on the edge, and that's really all the film is about. There's no character arc for him, and there's no real payoff for the audience since it ends just about the same way it starts. It is bereft of feeling and emotion for a war film that should contain both of these things. The gritty realism and excellent production for the movie is impressive, but for me, the movie just couldn't get off the ground.","349":"my overwhelming thought through and after this movie was that if this is how it really is in iraq and afghanistan then i understand why soldiers come back from combat seriously screwed in the head. it's no wonder that our world makes little sense after living in that reality for 365 days. as far as all the awards it got at the oscars this year, well, i don't really get how this is a better film than inglourious basterds. one thinks that the media and the academy are too afraid to not award medals to soldiers for being there. this is a movie not the actual war and inglourious basterds was a better movie no question.","350":"Super intense movie. Ending wasn't anything fancy. Renner played the role really well.","351":"The Hurt Locker provides another great interpretation of really goes on in the Iraq War. Nicely shot, Kathryn Bigelows casts Jeremy Renner to fulfill the movies lead role as he does a stellar job and succeeds. Action filled, suspenseful and intense, The Hurt Locker should amuse most war movie fans in many ways.","352":"Gripping and very tense movie with a good insight to life in the disposal bomb unit. Jeremy Renner is fantastic and the finale is tragic","353":"War is a drug. One man is addicted to it. It feels good and makes you crazy but generally unhealthy.Bigelow serves some ridiculous tension, man. Jeremy Renner's career grew cuz he's awesome as a bomb disarmer.","354":"If Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare took sedatives and was turned into a film, this would likely be it.","355":"undeniably one of the greatest war pictures ever made. and considering so much of the war in iraq and military experiences regarding it have been depreciated by dramatic conventions, Bigelow somehow manages to juggle a sense of suspense with an intense psychological wiring of ordinary Americans thrust into the unknown","356":"Thrilling from start to finish! Great script!","357":"Jeremy Renner is perfect in this and Bigelow shines as director, but best picture of the year? Not for me.","358":"An intense, thoughtful, well-acted, and subtle war-film, the first major release to talk about the Iraq War without preaching.","359":"Didn't find anything brilliant in the movie besides being a typical american war movie. Much watch this again.","360":"3 words... Awesome, Must See","361":"Intense. Probably the best war movie to come out of Iraq. A subtle message, great acting, and nail-biting action. Kathryn Bigelow came out of the depths of movie hell and delivered her finest feature to date. I mean, I still fucking love Point Break but this hits a completely different level of maturity from the most kick ass female director. The whole film is a time ticking adrenaline rush that follows one bomb squad unit in Iraq and counts down the days til the rotation ends and they can go home. It does have some scenes that drag on. It does occasionally run into war movie cliches, and the ending wasn't exactly what I'd hoped it'd be. But damn, this was a terrific surprise.","362":"A painfully overrated war flick that features a guy in the sand cutting a bunch of wires. Unless you're an expert bomb diffuser, you'd be hard pressed to find any tension in this eventless, aimless war flick until the final twenty minutes.","363":"very good war movie...","364":"A brutal view of the pointlessness of war, as told through the soldiers of the most pointless of wars. Watching a movie this raw can lead to the most heated of political discussions since it's hard not to have a harsh opinion if the reality of what these soldiers do are accurate and not overly Hollywood dramatized. Nevertheless, movies like this are not to be missed. The Hurt Locker shows that the art of storytelling through film doesn't require $250 million budgets to hit the viewer hard.","365":"I enjoyed Bigelow's film very much--it's a very accurate depiction of the unique problems both of the war in the Middle East and that soldiers of any war face--that fighting and surviving is all they know, to the deficit of everything else. I understand why it was shot the way that it was, though handheld, jerky movement isn't my cup of tea. This film gets a lot of hate because it beat out Avatar at the awards ceremonies. Though it's a very good film and deserving of great recognition, I don't think it's the best that Bigelow can do. I'm curious what she's going to try next.","366":"a near-perfect movie, with amazing actors","367":"Jeremy Renner is too good!","368":"Finally saw this. A powerful portrayal of the addiction to the adrenalin of war.","369":"awesome all around action","370":"Top 5 war flicks ever.","371":"The authenticity of the military spec ops makes me to think about this film. The natural Renner here gives him a name of one of the finest actors that we will see in the next future.","372":"difficult movie to watch and since I was never in combat I can't say if its a true one. Would like to hear from those who actually was. Nevertheless the explanation of why we fight is very believable.","373":"very good. i was pleasantly surprised.","374":"Well done, Kathryn Bigelow! She definitely deserved her Oscar win. All the actors were amazing as well. I loved the ending as well.","375":"i almost broke a rib in one of the deternation scenes. this film is so tense and suspenseful, i cant recall a film where i was out of breath on so many occasions. it perfectly captures the isolation and tension of the iraq war. it has given me a new found respect for the men who do this, but also a new found pity. why do they do what they do? why try to clean up someone elses mess?","376":"Does The Hurt Locker live up to its accolade or fall short of the highest honor to receive in cinema? Set in a war torn Iran where soldiers are at the risk of life and death, Jeremy Renner stars as Staff Sergeant William James replacement EOD who has a strange but intriguing addiction. You follow sergeant James through multiple combat missions coming face to face with death. As the movie progresses you find deep internal conflicts between characters and their environment that will fully engage you in the story. Along with the deep story Kathryn Bigelow directs earing herself the best director award form the academy, witch was well deserved. The Hurt Locker earns its badge of honor at a great four and a half stars out of five.","377":"After \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Apocalypse Now\" I never thought that another filmaker would make a war movie that managed to get to their feets ... Kathryn Bigelow succeeded in a FANTASTIC way.\"The Hurt Locker\" can be one of the best war movies of all time, explore and show's the Iraq war in a way never seen before, getting to be quite original in many details. One of the most positive and original points on the film is that it dosen't focuss attention on shootings sequences as other war films do, but explores the view of the soldiers, as they see and feel the war, putting the public on their places. Who sees the war on television or news, just see unnecessary killing and massacre between peoples and nations, yeah it is true but then people say that the soldiers are murderers. The film manages to explore this sense from the perspective of the soldiers, they are only there to follow rules, their job is being there, the soldiers only have each other and fight to protect the man on their side, we see that they count the days they spend in combat to return home soon which seems impossible. Mark Boal gets conveying this with a superb screenplay, shows reality in an impressive way. Not only is the screenplay is very real but also the impressive visual details that the film delivers.Another plus point in the film are the visual effects, giving the film an visual magnitude, impressive in every passing moment, and with the direction of Kathryn Bigelow everything is just amazing.The cast could not have been better for the story of these soldiers. Jeremy Renner gives a fantastic performance in every detail as Sergeant First Class William James; Anthony Mackie as Sergeant JT Sanborn and more; Brian Geraghty; Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes.From start to finish, \"The Hurt Locker\" gives an impressive view of the war in Iraq, stuffed maintenance; emotion; action and an impressive visual spectacle, one of the best war movies ever made.","378":"So freakin' intense!","379":"Finally got around to seeing this one. Really good movie about Iraq war from military bomb squad perspective.","380":"Outstanding performances by the actors and an amazing mood set by the director created an intense and memorable movie that ranks among the best war movies of the decade. I had hoped that the story would have been fleshed out a little more but overall, an amazing movie.","381":"great movie to watch...","382":"really good movie, good story","383":"Very realistic movie of our military in Iraq. About military bomb squad. I enjoyed it.","384":"This is a war film for girls. I suspect the US military paid to get it the best picture award.... Seriously, it beat Avatar, WTF? Who wants to watch a war movie where the characters never shoot their weapons, then cry on the odd occasion that they actually do pull the trigger? War movies should leave you questioning how they manage to fit that many bullets in a magazine, not show a character trying to shoot and nothing coming out of the barrel. There is a strong history of fantastic war films in Hollywood. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them.","385":"This is a movie about bombs. Lots of bombs. Desert bombs.The End.That's pretty much it. Oh sure, a few other things happened. You wanna hear about 'em? OK. I'll provide you with a little more, oh faithful reader.I'm still not sure what the title The Hurt Locker refers to. It's not about well-secured first aid kits, nor is it about gymnasium facilities for actors William, John, or even Mary Beth.This celluloid endeavor was directed by Kathryn Bigelow; the deft hand behind such legendary screen classics as Point Break and Blue Steel. It stars Jeremy Renner as Staff Sergeant William James, an expert at diffusing bombs. Joining him on the Explosivity Disposaling Unit are Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Owen Eldrige (Brian Geraghty)Renner has been nominated for an Academy Award for his performance. I'm not sure why this is. The supporting performances - most notably Mackie's - were, in my opinion, superior. All Renner did was act \"cool\". Oh, so \"cool\". Desert \"cool\". But if looking \"cool\" is the only criterion used for award recognition, then David Caruso should be nominated for a Nobel Prize.The film centers mostly on the antics of Sergeant James. James loves dismantling things that can blow you into a zillion pieces. He'd rather do that than live a peaceful life in a nice home with his beautiful wife. We're shown some of his domestic life, but the movie doesn't show the good stuff. No. Instead we see him cleaning out the eavestrough of his house.Now I've cleaned out a few roof gutters in my time, but the one depicted here has to be the gunkiest gutter in the history of home maintenance. And he's cleaning it out with his bare hand!!! C'mon, use a scoop, or a trowel, or a toy shovel, a stick, a shoe, anything. I'd rather diffuse bombs in Iraq than have to clean out that gutter in that fashion.Another scene worth mentioning shows the guys - after getting a little snockered - engaging in an activity where good judgment and mental acuity would be a distinct disadvantage. The \"game\" involves taking turns hitting each other as hard as possible in the stomach. My wife, while watching this powerful and touching scene, turned to me and asked, \"Why do men do those kind of things?\"You know, we men just have to chuckle when women ask us such questions. It was obvious to me, but I patiently explained it to her that this was a gesture of endearment. Women hug. Men try to smash the bejabers out of each other. It's their way of saying, \"You're OK in my book.\" And nothing says it better than a ruptured spleen.A word of warning here to those prone to seasickness: the camerawork in this film is of that hand-held style that so many directors are wont to use these days. I suppose they feel it gives their movies that gritty, realistic, documentary look - which is ironic, since documentary filmmakers rarely use the technique anymore. Besides, if it's supposed to look realistic, then why don't I see the real world that way through my eyes? Although if I did, I'd be making an appointment - and pronto - with an ophthalmologist or a brain surgeon.If you have a tough time watching this film due to that camera style, then avoid The Bourne Ultimatum at all costs. You would not survive. Its visuals are worse than any bone-jarring experience you could imagineI once took a ride on a gigantically tall roller coaster. Its peak disappeared into the clouds. It was called the Red Ripper, or the Brown Streak, or the Green Puker - something like that. Anyway, all I know is that I was smiling after that ride. I wasn't smiling after The Bourne Ultimatum.In closing, I should say that even though I had some reservations about renting the DVD of The Hurt Locker, I was able to take something positive from it - a lesson.The lesson learned is, pay attention to your reservations.","386":"An exceptionally well-made war picture that offers a unique and somewhat controversial view of a soldier's addiction to danger. It's unbearably tense at times, directed by Bigelow with impeccable craft. Renner's character is your typical defiant rebel (and his pompousness can get obnoxious), and the film seeks to continually restate its thesis more than plumb it's depths, but \"The Hurt Locker\" is still powerful and engaging.","387":"This could so easily be perfect, but the inaccuracies are a huge disappointment. But pretty much everything else is amazingly well done.","388":"A deep and emotional story a must see!","389":"The Hurt Locker is an intense, nail-biting, palm sweating, eyes glaring experience. Kathryn Bigelow does a great job as director bringing this story to life and Jeremy Renner delivers a notable performance to a badass but likeable character. This is a movie that gets better every time you watch it.","390":"Jeremy Renner and Guy Pearce are amazing so i cant wait to see it!","391":"Portrays Iraquis , whose country was just invaded due to a GWB lie, as enemy. Instead of decent people fighting for their country, IN their own backyard.","392":"Despite a strong and dedicated performance from Jeremy Renner, it is a slow and dull film.","393":"See my WAY too long Facebook note for why I didn't enjoy this Academy Award nominated movie.","394":"The Hurt Locker hands down is one of the most intense, terrifying, and realistic depictions of the modern War fare. Kathryn Bigelow deserves every accolade for her excellent vision on this film.","395":"An in-depth look into the dangers behind an EOD squad, Kathryn Bigelow succeeds in capturing the addiction to war and the problems it serves.","396":"Great movie one of my favorites but not a great title","397":"One of my favorite movies about war in the Middle East. Great actors, love the story and very entertaining can't get much better.","398":"I had mixed to low expectations prior to watching The Hurt Locker, but I must say, it was highly enjoyable. Jeremy Renner is such a badass in this movie.","399":"Over-rated is good word for this. The themes of dehumanization and alienation will be found in any war-drama, like All Quiet on the Western Front, Deer Hunter, Platoon and Saving Private Ryan, so it's really hard to do anything new and compelling. The Hurt Locker tries by giving us the perspective from a bomb removal unit, instead of the usual old infantry ground-pounder stuff. While I appreciate that, there are also too many flaws for the movie to draw me in, including characters acting in such a strikingly unprofessional way as to undermine my suspension of disbelief, downright clich\u00e9 that are masked but not as cleverly as the director thought (yes, the Americans just has to save those Brits, huh?) and the eternally annoying shaken-camera style and fast editing that is supposed to mimic documentary-style work, but only serves to chop the narrative up and make it really hard to follow what is happening during the action scenes.","400":"Probably the best film made about modern war. Very authentic realistic looking film, its not your usual Hollywood goes to Iraq movie. Powerful, thought provoking, this film is the first about Iraq war to have made me feel this way.","401":"The Hurt Locker was the subject of a lot of hype. For me, it's all talk and very little action. The talking isn't bad, because the actors are pretty good. For me, this movie's major malfunction is advertising itself as a war movie while not having enough action scenes. I think that would help the film's portrayal of the war rather than hindering it. But instead, they went for overly detailed explosions that do nothing other than make the movie last longer. The movie's not bad. It just spends so much time being pompous and dramatic instead of entertaining. If I were one of the BAFTA judges, I wouldn't have voted for this film.","402":"Other than a few timeline mistakes this was truly phenomenal. The acting and cinematography were so real... easily the best war movie I've seen since Full Metal Jacket.","403":"Great acting from Jeremy Renner. Kathryn Bigelow made a daring attempt to capture this grisly realism, though it paid off and is totally worthy of an Oscar for Renner, screenplay and directing.","404":"It is a great movie, I just don't think it deserved the academy award for best picture","405":"A fine film with fine performances but not as good as the academy says it was.","406":"it shows what these heros do to save lives. i wasnt that into it. my gf liked it more.","407":"A greatly realistic and gritty film, The Hurt Locker does just what it wants to do, and owns it, but after a while a few elements used like the shaky cam become a bit overwhelming.","408":"The Hurt locker is a wonderful film that are power by great performances from Jeremy Renner and the rest of the cast, but also manages to bring up the question what would if you weren't scared of death?","409":"Monday, December 20, 2010(2008) The Hurt LockerWAR \"The Hurt Locker\" or a \"Soldier's Journal\", starts out with a new recruit for this particular group, and his name is Sergeant First Class William James, played memorably by Jeremy Renner, since the other \"Bomb Tech\" got killed in action! I have to say in terms of the emotions, atmosphere or the experience, it felt quite real because this is \"only\" accordingly to \"one\" particular group and only one guy, who does not have a political agenda whether or not they should be there on the front lines or not, but what they're assigned to do, and is still a job no matter how big the risks are! It is a 24 hour job because \"one\" would not know when one is ever needed to undetonate an explosive device and it is something any sane person would not want to look forward to. But as the movie progressed, the only way this person were to confront this, as the other two soldiers observed while working alongside with him is to \"psyche\" yourself out as sort of an adrenline rush because your life can be gone in an instant! One of the most powerful lines here was when the star of the film says, \"we need more bomb techs here in Iraq\" because this job is not at all appealing! And although the movie is plotless, the experiences about a single persons journey toward war is very accurately portrayed here, since most of them spend much of their life living on a thread, and is not like spending it on the Bahamas sunbathing in the sun. And upon returning to the US for a tempory leave to spend some quality time with his family, that it was like coming back to a whole new world all over again, and hard for Will to adjust back to a life of normacy, when at the same time, knows that he still has to go back to a war that doesn't seem to end!  Also what this movie provides are what would happened if a soldier were to leave it's compound, and they're also some hazing. And although, drinking alcohol may not be too accurate, it could be a reflection of previous wars Americans had experienced, such as when the US army were fighting in Vietnam or in WWII against the Japanese and Germany!  I wanted to give this film a much higher rating, but I feel that the first incident was 100% avoidable which regards holding up a cell phone, and the soldier Sergeant JT Sanborn played by Anthony Mackie who was pointing a gun at this guy told him to put it down and instead of just either shooing him or shooting the phone on his hand, for some strange reason he just allowed him to continue to press the buttons on his phone anyway, causing the explosion to go off! But the reason for this was to introduce the Jeremy Renner character!If I was asked whether or not it deserved \"Best Picture\" as well as a bunch of other Oscar awards! And the answer is- \"yes\" it does, because it is the first film I had ever saw from the perspective of a soldier and not accordingly to some high official general sitting behind a desk if the war is controlled onto the desert field!CONTAIN SPOILERSI've just recently purchased this film and would have to say that the last 20 minutes of the film is the most powerful I had ever saw about the desert war, one of few scenes regards a conversation with his wife, and Will wants to just have something to talk about, but doesn't really have anything to tell her except about his war experiences, and she obviously does not want to hear about young kids blowned up by some suicidal bomber and instead says 'chop these carrots for me', there's also a social commentary about why soldiers can't make bonds with the peaceful civilians living amongst them while fighting because if they have a rapport with some of them and then get killed by some senseless attack, may take a toll on the soldiers lives or feel guilty about it! And would have to say that the ending is one of the most strongest I had ever saw, because at the beginning of the film, Soldier Will starts to counts the number of days until his next leave to see his family and then at the end of the film, after staying with them for a few days or weeks, he had to go back again, back to the sidelines starting his count this time from 365 Days left for his next leave, if he lives that is!  3 out of 4","410":"It's a pretty overrated film, but \"The Hurt Locker\" does contain one very suspenseful sniper sequence and some intense bomb-defusing scenes, and a cast that knows exactly what they are doing.","411":"Not a huge fan of set piece after set piece..as a result there is not much 'plot'. That said the set pieces are gripping, tense and shot with great precision,","412":"Even though the war in the Middle East has calmed down a bit in recent years, it is still a touchy subject. So it was a bold move for Kathryn Bigelow to delve into the heart of the war in the war drama, \"The Hurt Locker\". Based on real-life accounts, this film follows the story of a fictional bomb disposal squad in Iraq.For a movie about war, it's surprising how beautiful \"The Hurt Locker\" is. Not only is the film beautifully shot, but the dramatic story-telling is also quite beautiful. Don't get me wrong though, this is still very much an action film, and every time Sgt. James suits up, the movie becomes suspenseful and intense.Much of the beauty of \"The Hurt Locker\" is the result of the outstanding cast of the film. Jeremy Renner delivers an excellent performance as Sgt. James, bringing the right amount of cocky, crazy, and endearing to his character. Likewise, Anthony Mackie (Sanborn) and Brian Geraghty (Eldrige) give equally enjoyable supporting performances.Though \"The Hurt Locker\" sometimes pushes the boundaries of belief (i.e. if an actual soldier disobeyed orders and went rogue the number of times Sgt. James does, he would be dishonorably discharged), the film is overall a very accurate account of the war in Iraq. It is sad at times. It is happy at times. It is terrifying at times. But regardless of the mood, it is a heavy film. But I think what sells me the most on \"The Hurt Locker\" is its unexpected ending, which is great and an interesting choice.","413":"Best movie of our generation","414":"A pointless movie. That's what this is. Take one of the most recent wars and write a movie that doesn't know what it means.","415":"slightly boring a little drawn out in my opinion. Renner did a great job, everyone else was poorly developed, entirely ancillary and if the black dude wasnt the prototypical \"alpha black dude who, of course at some point has to punch the leading white dude, entirely forgettable. but hey, they managed to lobby the oscar out of the 2 billion dollar avatar film, might as well see it","416":"The Hurt Locker will divide the audience's opinions in regards to accuracy and it's theme, but stands out as an impresive war film\/character study nonetheless.","417":"What it lacks in structure it makes up in visceral power.","418":"Movies like this come around every 3 years or so.","419":"Utter piece of shit!","420":"I know it has got lots of message and all that but it wasn't entertaining.","421":"If I'm gonna die, I want to die comfortable.","422":"The Hurt Locker is the best war film in many years. The great performances, the masterful directing, and the rip-roaring action all unite to catapult this epic to massive heights.","423":"Positively GRIPPING. A mesmerizing look at the frightening addiction of war.","424":"intense. spoiler--- beware bomb in body. super disturbing. eughgreat ending","425":"it was real from start to finish.. Renner, Mackie, & Geraghty chemistry is flawless..","426":"Awesome war film with more of a psychological emphasis. I really liked it.","427":"A complex character study and meditation on war with some of the best direction and editing I've seen this decade.","428":"The best war movie Ive ever seen.","429":"The story of a man who is fearless in doing a dangerous job, but not as fearless in his personal life.A patriotic movie that honors the warriors without commenting pro or con on the the wars in Afghanistan or Iraq. A great Memorial Day double feature would be The Hurt Locker (2008) followed by The Messenger (2009). Both films will make you proud of today's American military.","430":"The only thing carrying this movie is good acting. The story is boring and very repetitive. After an hour I felt like I was wasting my time.","431":"A brilliant film that I absolutely hated. Will never watch it again, but will never forget.","432":"an intense drama warfilm. way beyond expectation","433":"I work for the distributor of this film, that being said, it is a great movie!!There is no political agenda here on either side, just a soldiers perspective of being in Iraq. Great performances, cool cameos, excellent direction, all from an amazing script. I highly recommend this film. It opens in LA and NY next week and then will go wider. The best movie I've seen this year.","434":"The movie has a strong story and realness that flies above its overdramtic and one dimensional war-movie counterparts","435":"A great piece of work. Even though there's not much action like in other great war movies, other great aspects of this film still make it a great war movie. The pressure to get the right shot, the dedication of staying in the same position with an assault rifle even though your getting tired, and the relationships you make with the friendly native people. One part I loved was when James and Sanborn were concentrating on taking out the enemies from far away in the two windowed building, the amazing shot of the fly going in James' eye. You definitely sensed the concentration and dedication in the young sergeant. I can understand Jeremy Renner's Oscar nomination. I wonder if we will ever see him with one again, or will he (god forbid) become the next James Bond. I can definitely see why and how this film won best picture, but I still would've voted for Avatar. I now have no reason to be mad that this one best picture. Congrats Kathryn Bigelow and also congrats on being known as the first female director to win for best director. I'm so happy I finally got to see this film before I see Zero Dark Thirty. The Hurt Locker, I give you an 80%.","436":"Intense movie with a strong ending","437":"A relentlessly terrifying experience that's more than the sum of the shots fired or the bombs disarmed, Director Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is a picture that's true to the horrors of War -- particularly the psychological anguish incurred even in place of physical harm -- and not the run-and-gun action normally associated with lesser-in-meaning War movies. With a strong cast; exceptional direction and cinematography; and a moving, often gut-wrenching thematic overtone that analyzes the fragility of the human condition through the prism of the uncertainty of war, The Hurt Locker sets a new standard for genre excellence and has solidified itself as a contemporary War movie classic.","438":"Gripping, intense, and extremely well-acted, \"The Hurt Locker\" shows the war like never before. Jeremy Renner is in his breakout performance, which will eventually lead him to superstardom. As we follow a bomb-defusing team, we are placed in events that seem so real you will be on the edge of your seat, hoping for our cast to make it out alive. The writing is terrific, the direction is top-notch, and the story is displayed to perfection. Kathryn Bigalow's \"The Hurt Locker\" is definitely my favourite film of 2009!","439":"The scene, characters and performances are amazing. But i wish there is more progress on the storyline instead leaving lots of questions unanswered.","440":"unrealistic war scenes","441":"A beautiful example of quality film making.","442":"Some outcome of Kathryn Bigelow to the war of Hurt Locker. Maybe it's a hard war, but in the Oscar it's not","443":"Absolutely the worst shaky cam movie I have ever tried to watch, even worse than Captain Phillips! Guarantee you will have a headache within ten minutes...","444":"This war drama about a bomb squard in Iraq is uncommonly human.","445":"A gripping and heroic tale depicting the war in Iraq. From the start of the film it grabs you and won't let you look away till the end. The accurate depiction of the war combined with the flawless acting and emotions make this one of the best war movies to date.","446":"I know Im gonna get alot of hits for this but this movie wasnt all it was cracked up to be it's just slow and boring to the point where I was falling asleep I became less interested as it progressed sorry but I fail to see why this movie won Best Picture of 2009 this movie is BS from beginning to finish","447":"180126: This was the film of the year? Bad year I guess. Are we supposed to be shocked by the ugliness of war and terrorist tactics? These films, which attempt to portray people on the edge of psychological stability, are always weak. William James is not a hero; he's a detriment to his team. He's not a hero, he's a hazard.","448":"Terrible. Absolutely terrible. I literally signed up with this website to protest this movie.","449":"I finally saw this. It's probably the best movie I've seen in... like, 5 years? This is a movie about how men are, directed by a woman. I know there were some military types who quibbled with its accuracy. But for there was a stark realness to this that most action movies never seem to simulate. Not so much a war movie than a movie about male aggression suppressed and redirected until some kind of tantra is attained.","450":"It's a passable action flick. The tension is forced most of the time. Jeremy Renner is a supporting actor (see Hawkeye). The cinematography was great. Sound very well done. Only won best film because it was directed by a woman and was up against a weak field.","451":"Puntaje Original: 8.0Tensa y brillante a la vez, con una soberbia direcci\u00f3n de Kathryn Bigelow.","452":"I have seen a lot of movies. They vary from good, bad, made by Martin Scorsese, or Uwe Boll. But, this movie tops my favorites list. It's fantastic how Kathryn Bigelow joins forces with Mark Boal, and together they made this phenomenal project that is completely overlooked by everyone. I mean everyone forgets this movie because they don't like complex storytelling. This movie is more than complex. It's realistic. The action is realistic. There's only 2 or 3 slow-mo shots, there are a few explosions, and there's no guns-a-blazing. This movie portrays the army in the most respectful way.","453":"This film was epic the drama was intense and the war scenes were cooler than ever I like this film better than Avatar!","454":"Pretty boring and contrived for an Oscar winner about bomb specialists.","455":"Well, I tried again to watch this riveting Oscar winner. I don't know why it's shot like a music video - I don't know why so many music videos are shot in a way that is antithetical to the way the human brain takes in information through the eye - and I don't know why it doesn't seem to bother so many people - but it makes the screen unwatchable for me. It is not an intellectual choice on my part, although I can use my intellect to analyze the problem.I might even be able to manage if it was just the fast cutting...or just the faux-photojournalist stitching, as in let's pretend that the audience is the cameraman, and so we see the camera zooming in and out as if it were trying to choose its focus...but these two together completely pull me out of the story - makes me want to scream - stop playing with the camera and let me see what is going on!Greenblatt says it makes the viewer feel like he is in the war zone, and I guess Bigelow feels that way too, but no one I know who's been in a battle agrees with them.The brain always tries to settle in on a picture so that it can figure out what is going on - yes, that is difficult to do in battle, but the brain makes an effort, and effort that is made impossible here, because the camera (via the camera work itself and the multi-angle cutting) forces, as it were, the eye to flit quickly from one impossible angle to another.On the other hand, if I have to watch this kind of camera work and editing, in its style it seems to me about as well done as is possible, on its own terms.In every other way, for my money, it's a stunning film. In particular, I like the use of silence, the composition of the story itself, the utterly natural dialogue that yet moves the story along without showing its stitches at all (completely opposite from the camera work in that regard), as well as the oft-praised acting and directing.My friend and excellent young filmmaker Alex Keipper in his review made an interesting point about the theme, which is explicitly stated at the film's outset, and well developed. I have many thoughts on the subject, which I won't go into here, except to say that for me it is a little too pat an explanation to say that some men are attracted to battlefield as a 'drug'...Robert Capa was famously disdainful of the comment.There is truth in it, no doubt, but it smacks a little of the bourgeois, of the outsider looking in. If a man feels more alive in the face of danger, a feeling I've experienced myself, perhaps the problem is not in the so-called addiction, but in what is missing in the world 'back home'. Something starkly and poetically suggested in the supermarket scene, shelves stuffed banally with ridiculous deserts masquerading as childrens' breakfasts. Which scene, indeed, is the more surreal?...the young Iraqi boy hawking pirated DVDs, or the blandness of abundance such that food itself has been made into entertainment, and American popular music, one of the great cultural gifts to the world, is reduced to the dullest possible orchestration to create a Muzak to shop by?","456":"A very good movie. Although some scenes were pretty much unrealistic.","457":"This movie is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. The action, the suspense, the story, the realism is just fantastic. Jeremy Renner had a great performance","458":"Take that James Cameron Assatar!","459":"Full of tension and action. The Hurt Locker is a needed movie which is held back by strange editing.","460":"This has a bold introduction and carries on thrilling. This can easily stand aside great war movies like Saving Private Ryan. Gripping film.","461":"Jeremy Renner was fantastic. Action's great. Yea....better than the film achievment that was Avatar? Not by a long shot.","462":"It has the feel of a documentary more than a film, but nevertheless it's a must-see. Not only does it feature the utter craziness of how Iraq evolved, it also confronts you with a sociopathic character brilliantly played by Jeremy Renner.","463":"the most realistic war movie ever seen..Bigelow cheers up for this academy award winning movie, beating his ex husband James Cameron with high budget Avatar..","464":"Now THAT is living. Going to shit places and putting your life on the line daily, for shit money. I really felt the tension","465":"Given the hype of this film I was disappointed. The idea was excellent but it didn't materialise into a solid execution for me.","466":"Perfectly portrays life in the uniform.","467":"This is one of my absolute favorite films. I love military\/action films and this is by far the best I've seen about the current war. Jeremy Renner is fantastic along with the rest of the cast. He breathes new life into this bomb squad who loses their previous squad mate to a bomb of course. Hated at first for his careless antics and the way he goes about diffusing situations, but he gets the job done. This film helped me to become a huge fan of Renner who I had only previously seen in The Town an Swat. Must see for anyone, as long as you can handle the language\/violence.","468":"Very, very suspenseful.","469":"An intense film. Apocalypse Now and FMJ have become the quintessential Vietnam war films, Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List represent WW2 films and for the Iraqi war there's The Hurt Locker.","470":"This movie was awesome! Jeremy Renner is great as the lead and the bomb diffusing scenes are intense.","471":"I was surprised how much I like this movie.","472":"I really understand about this film... because this is not really about your typical stereotyped war movies... this is really about the true story that every soldiers have some problems when they are back home and really feel it is not the same way that they used to be.... and even though, in the Islamic countries, would found this as a disgrace because it was in Iraq, and terrorist or etc... but people should not judged by its cover or the trailer or the film itself... some people kind of really sensitive about the setting or the subject.... TRULY A WELL-DONE FILM!!!!!","473":"should be called The Overrated Locker","474":"One of my all-time favorites","475":"Excellent war movie. Followed by a great performance by Jeremy RennerB+","476":"great movie all around but the camera was shaky at some points.","477":"I liked it alot. Do I think it should have won the academy award? No...","478":"One of worst best picture winners ever","479":"Even 5 years later it's still an incredible movie, tense, dramatic but still human. A great war film and a superb character study. The question isn't how you live on the edge, it's how you don't.","480":"Definitely deserving of the the nominations.","481":"One of worst best picture winners ever","482":"Una interesante y llena de accion toca temas de moralidad y miedo durante la guerra","483":"Thought provoking and very human story of punctuated stress, this movie is paced and formatted almost video game like, in that there are periods of incredible tension and violence (in the form of the bomb missions) interspersed with moments of \"story\". My biggest issue is how these missions quickly become repetitive in their structure, and how the characters are allowed very little time between action sequences to breathe.","484":"I only knew Jeremy Renner from the Avengers prior to watching this and he was good in that. He is outstanding in this as a man who is addicted to disarming bombs. Very tense in parts and like real warfare unpredictable. You watch on your guard as you expect things to happen...or not.","485":"First it was Departures, and now this. Yet another movie that could have been great...if only a good 30 minutes was cut from its runtime. The Hurt Locker has fantastic action scenes which are extremely suspenseful, very funny and witty dialogue, solid character development, great cinematography, and a brilliant ending. Unfortunately with its 2 hour and 10 minute runtime, the film drags, and the action scenes start to lose its excitement. While I'm not always a huge advocate of 3 act structure, this is a film that 3 act structure purists can have a field day with criticizing. When the film hammers on action scene after action scene after action scene after action scene, you're pretty much climaxed out. When the film stops the action for a dialogue scene, it's such a welcome change. It's too bad, because this is a film that wants to show the day to day life of a bomb technician, therefore a 3 act structure would not work. At an hour and a half, this would have been a much better movie and not tired the audience out. The Hurt Locker is an Iraq war movie with no political agenda. It's simply about the life of a guy who disarms bombs and happens to be really good at it. Every single time he goes to work, there's a good 50\/50 chance he won't make it out alive. As an action movie, it is probably the best of any movie this year. It's unpredictable, you really don't know who will make it out alive which makes it more suspenseful. I know some people may complain about the shakiness of the camera, but it gives you the, \"It feels like you're there\" feeling. The cinematography is brilliant. Often the film shows you exactly what the soldier can see which makes it even more intense. The soldiers know about as much as we do about who are the bad guys and who are the innocent civilians in Iraq. You can feel the fear that the soldiers are experience. There's moments which include showing us the POV of looking through a sniper rifle. The vision is so blurry, you can't make out what is out there, but it looks like it could be an Iraqi who could be holding a sniper rifle aiming at you...or maybe not. What should the soldier do? The movie shows all the uncertainties of day to day life of serving in Iraq, which adds to the suspense. The acting in general is all very good. The dialogue is full of witty zingers, and the main character is very interesting. All the character work is very well done. His backstory, his life back in the U.S, his collection of souvenirs is all great stuff. After a while you kind of want the action to end to show a little more of the soldiers as people.This movie is very well done in all areas and has many memorable moments. But if you ask me whether I have any desire to see the whole movie again, I'd probably say no. On DVD, I may skip to certain scenes, but I wouldn't wanna watch it all over again.It really is too bad, because none of the content was bad. It's all great stuff, but believe it or not, action scenes going non-stop can get tiring. It was frustrating watching this. The first 40 minutes in, I thought I was watching one of the best films of the year. Close to the 2nd hour, I was wondering when it was going to end. Don't let me dissaude you. This is still a very well done movie and I fully encourage everyone to see it. With the huge critical praise, you may feel disappointed if you end up liking it, but not loving it.","486":"Good movie...but I think it's way over-hyped.","487":"\"The Hurt Locker\" is the best American war film since \"Three Kings.\" Its the first successful non-documentary Iraq War movie that shows us the continuous, life-threatening danger faced by an Army bomb squad. Kathryn Bigelow uses her action director skills to maximum effect to create an intense, visceral experience of war. The squad is in constant fear of survival but goes about their routine tasks of trying to diffuse bombs while keeping an eye out for civilians who could trigger the explosive device. There is a phenomenal sequence of the restlessness before a shootout. The movie bogs down a bit near the end when a solider goes on an investigative mission and the trio searches for a suicide bomber in enemy territory. The concluding segment of a soldier's struggle to adapt to life with his family is moving in its simplicity. A great film with terrific performances, most notably by Jeremy Renner. With Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty, Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, Evangeline Lilly, Christian Camargo. Won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Original Screenplay, Film Editing, Sound Effects Editing, Sound Mixing.","488":"A compelling, well-acted and high-intensity war film.","489":"Obviously The Hurt Locker has impressed many, but it can't impress all.","490":"The hurt locker is one of the best war I've ever seen , Jeremy Renner in particular is really awesome and intense. It will give you a rush of adrenaline and also will make you reflect on the work of the soldier.","491":"This film is awesome the war films era at its best the whole film keeps you tense and every second they are on the field you are waiting to see what happens next there are even some holy s@ moments that will have you screaming at your T.V highly recommended.","492":"Well directed, acted and completely pointless.","493":"Awesome Awesome movie! It really needs to be seen because it is so intense at times and it really makes you think about what our soldiers go through day by day. It is not trying to make a political statement, it just shows soldiers and what they do.","494":"THE HURT LOCKER is a tense but emotionally distant war film from director Kathryn Bigelow, and starring Jeremy Renner. It follows an Army bomb disposal unit around as they do their job in war-torn Iraq. Unlike most war films it doesn't really take a stance on whether or not we should even be there, instead focusing on the psychology of warfare and what it does to the human mind. I thought that this approach mostly worked, although it kept the audience at a certain distance emotionally from the characters. The main character is played by Jeremy Renner, and he is the sergeant in charge of the unit. He is brash, reckless and one could almost say he has a death wish. What is closer to the truth is that he just loves what he does, and the thrill he gets from doing it. Also in his unit are another sergeant and a specialist played by Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty, respectively. They serve as counterpoint to Renner's character, and as a rational check against his unbridled nature. While most of the film deals with their bomb-defusing exploits, there are some moments when the true ugliness of the Iraq War shows its face, such as a tense nighttime scene in which Renner's character stalks someone he thinks is responsible for the death of a young street vendor he met. He ends up in the wrong place and just leaves before the situation escalates. It is in moments like that where the film hints at a possibly deeper reading of the film in terms of whether we should have even been in Iraq in the first place. That being said, the film is well-acted by everyone involved and the handheld cinematography worked in its favor, putting the viewer into the heat of the situations that arose. I guess my biggest gripe would be that it never explicitly challenges American presence in Iraq, but it's not necessarily a film's job to do that for you. With what it portrayed, and who the main character was, it still allows you to draw your own conclusions. For one, it must take a special someone to be a bomb disposal expert. And also, not everyone is cut out for combat. Overall, THE HURT LOCKER is a solid piece of filmmaking and an interesting look into modern warfare.","495":"The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug.\u00a0From the very first scene of this film, it's clear that it's a cut above the cookie cutter action films which Hollywood pumps out on assembly lines nowadays. Just how far is unclear until further along in the film, but if the first scene isn't enough to grip you like a vice, I don't know what is.\u00a0Staff Sergeant William James, played with beautiful restraint by Jeremy Renner, is a bomb tech in Iraq, not the best combination. However, unlike most normal people, Will finds bombs a rush, a thrill, almost a turn-on. Each time he goes out, it seems as though he's having more fun than at any point in time. This becomes even more apparent towards the end of the film, where he tries to connect with his wife and child by telling them horror stories of Iraq. He fumbles with his other relationships, with his wife, with his team members, with the local kid selling dvds, though he's solid as a rock when it comes to being less than a foot from a live explosive. Renner plays this role pitch perfect the whole way through the film, whether he's calling his wife or lighting up what might as well be a post-coital cigarette after a hair raising, nail biting experience with a bomb.\u00a0The film, though it's war film, steers clear of the politics of why the troops are there in the first place, opting instead to show what's happening to the boys who are over there. And how perfectly it shows this, from Sanborn's emotional breakdown after a particularly harrowing experience (to say any more would mean spoilers), to James' loss of composure during a house raid, the script is a perfect balance between smarmy and heartbreaking.\u00a0Brian Geraghty's performance as Specialist Owen Eldridge is worth a special mention. Every time he's onscreen he inhabits his character entirely. When he tells his psychologist what's playing on his mind and when he mourns the victims of a bomb blast, he is perfect in both situations.\u00a0But it is the set pieces which make the movie the movie which may actually beat Avatar. Each one is gripping, a thriller movie in itself where the outcomes are unclear, everyone is a suspect and every moment could be someone's last. The movie does little more than follow the everyday movements of Bravo company, but each day is more intense than the last. And the ending is perfect. There could be no other option for how this film could finish. In fact, I would have felt cheated if everyone had lived happily ever after, and the fact that you left wondering not only how crazy Will really is, but whether his luck is still within the best before date.\u00a0Defining Scene:\u00a0An illegally parked car sparks a whole set of problems. Or the one where case hardened steel causes a major incident.","496":"Tense and indeed worthy of its multiple Oscars.","497":"Phenomenal movie, just amazing.","498":"I think where Locker lacks is in its haphazard characters, who despite their realistic setting, behave senselessly. Obviously the movie isn't focused on realism in plot, but because the environment is so spot-on, you're left to wonder a bit about the writing. It's an achievement as a whole, but its criticisms from servicemen and women are surely valid.","499":"great way to show ppl how life is like for an american soldier out in iraq","500":"Pretty boring shit, but it's really impressive that it was directed by a woman, because usually, female directors are all about the touchie feelie stuff, but this movie was too gritty, heavily influenced by 80s action flicks, poor James Cameron, this lady is a dude!","501":"While Katheryn Bigelow's Iraq war-themed thriller may not be totally realistic in terms of its depiction of military protocol, it's a riveting movie anchored by Jeremy Renner's strong lead performance. This was a Best Picture Oscar choice I totally agreed with.","502":"A sort of wannabe thriller that gets by off of everyone's fear of things that go boom. Still alright though.","503":"Yawn. Don't know why I bother watching war films. Jeremy Renner does make a convincing arsehole though.","504":"A very specific selection from the quote that opens the film, taken from Chris Hedge's \"War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning\", sums up the next 133 minutes of Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker in just four words: \"war is a drug.\" It's a sentiment that mirrors the mindset of Jeremy Renner's Staff Sergeant William James, who is fearlessly calm in coordinating his EOD squad. Too calm, perhaps, to the point where his actions continuously risk his own life, and the lives of his fellow squad members, including Anthony Mackie's by-the-book Staff Sergeant JT Sanborn and Brian Geraghty's emotionally naive Owen Eldridge. It's a war film, but at its core, Mark Boal's screenplay is a character study of how war affects everyone: as their tour of duty winds down, these three soldiers and their worldviews are changed quite drastically as tensions continuously rise. The film lacks a single, overarching plot, which occasionally hurts the film's pacing, but allows for plenty of character moments between Renner, Mackie, and Geraghty, all of whom give strong performances.Kathryn Bigelow directs the film with a sense of raw and gritty viscerality, especially when the story necessitates intense action sequences. Bigelow understands how the war works: there's no huge shootouts with running-and-gunning and constant explosions from entire militaries here. Between the handheld camerawork and the general lack of a noticeable musical score, the EOD bomb disposal scenes are filmed in a way that feels like a guitar string is being wound too tight, and could snap at any minute. They're slow paced, but deliberately, and effectively so. It's as if we're stuck down in the sandy streets of Baghdad with these soldiers, and there's no telling who's going to come out of each mission in one piece.This Best Picture and Best Director winning film (Bigelow is the first, and currently the only, female to win both of these awards) is simultaneously a phenomenal war film, with perhaps the strongest onscreen portrayal of the Iraq War to date, and a fascinating character study of the effects of said war. The Hurt Locker is a must-see.","505":"Damn this is a good film","506":"Lengthy and sometimes repetative, but an honest view of life in the \"troop\".","507":"A grim but necessary look at the war.","508":"A fantastic yet different take on a modern day war movie, Instead of fast paced action we get amazing suspense nearly the whole way through the film, Some amazing acting and a breakthrough performance by Jeremy Renner, It has small bits of action but it's not what you will remember about this film, The director takes us on an emotional rollercoaster with the lives of our heroes overseas and really makes us bond with the cast, It's almost the perfect modern day war film and can see why it won film of the year at the Oscars.","509":"This movie will blow you away. Quite literally.","510":"What I remember of it was being enthralled. 8-9\/10?","511":"Outstanding job by Jeremy Renner, one of the very best...","512":"The fact that this movie is 97% is appalling. This is by far the worst \"war movie\" of all time. It's unrealistic, corny AF, and just an overall bad movie. I can't believe so many people liked this film, it's absolute shit.","513":"A well-executed war movie that neither laments the travesty of war, nor glorify war's heroics with cliche patriotic elements. The suspense is well-played and gripping both on the part of the director and the actors. Moments of the screenplay felt a bit contrived at times, and, as reported by US military members, there are some \"Hollywood interpretations\" of the Iraq war going on here. Still, as a work of film it stands as one of the more honest and less preachy war films in American history.","514":"the hurt locker and a horrible war movie","515":"Fast-paced direction, excellent performances, combat-filled thrills makes \"The Hurt Locker\" the best war movie of the generation even if it is about finding bombs, it's breath-taking.","516":"An intriguing as well as cerebral look at one man's addiction to being at war, as well as the relationship he carries with his fellow troops. Its focused direction by action film dame Kathryn Bigelow, and riveting performance from Jeremy Renner are splendidly navigated by Mark Boal's intelligent script. A pioneering entry into a new wave of war thrillers.","517":"A vastly interesting, multi-facetted wartime story with a certain grasp on realism versus cinematic elegance that few directors could have captured like Bigelow.","518":"Bigelow is a genius at building suspense, and she succeeds with flying colors in this movie, building up tension in every scene. Not only is war hell, but it is also a drug that is contagious to every soldier in the battlefield, and screenwriter Mark Boal makes sure of it.His screenplay is rock solid and the whole cast is pitch perfect. I was at the edge of my seat throughout the film. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.","519":"this movie was made by Cameron's ex wife and everybody chose this as best picture to piss off Cameron.","520":"Bigelow's masterpiece war thriller is spearheaded by Renner's spectacular performance as a soldier high on the thrill of war, and provides insightful personal perceptions of war.","521":"A movie that beautifies warfare. (Actually, there was this scene where my roomie and I so much agreed that Jeremy Runner's hips were extraordinary... Seen 11d ago with roomie at dorm.)","522":"Should have never won the Oscar. Low budget film about the very important military bomb squad operations.","523":"A spellbinding and devastating examination of how a war zone becomes both hell and comfort zone for those who fight.","524":"The war in Iraq has taken many lives; because, as you\u00e2(TM)d expect, it\u00e2(TM)s very dangerous. Yet nothing is quite as dangerous as working in a bomb disposal unit. For a bomb disposal unit, there are all sorts of safety precautions; however renegade Sergeant William James, a reckless man who frequently risks the lives of his unit, disregards almost every precaution, as he descends further into addiction: an addiction to war.  The Iraq War was bloody, brutal and took no prisoners. Director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal portray the war stunningly accurately, with high-octane gunfights and nerve-shredding scenes that deliver the intensity of bomb disposing in heart-pounding fashion.  When you watch The Hurt Locker, a powerful war epic that follows a highly trained bomb disposal unit lead by Sergeant William James, you will find yourself enthralled and immersed in Bigelow\u00e2(TM)s web of swearing, bombs, cigarettes and a bloody and high-octane war. Because from the nerve-wracking opening bomb disposal failure, to the emotional final ten minutes, Bigelow will have you perched on the edge of your seat, thirsty for more action.  Another huge positive that Kathryn Bigelow can boast about are the marvellous performances demonstrated by the cast. Anthony Mackie must get a mention thanks to his passionate portrayal of Sergeant J.T Sanborn and as does Brian Geraghty who shines brightly throughout the film, especially in a raging rant aimed at James, as Specialist Owen Eldridge, a man who is a tad emotionally unstable. However Jeremy Renner completely steals the show, portraying Sergeant William James, as he channels grit, sorrow and anger into one Academy Award\u00c2 (R) nominated performance. On the other hand I felt that there wasn\u00e2(TM)t a clear storyline other than Sergeant William James\u00e2(TM)s character development which while it\u00e2(TM)s interesting to watch, you will find yourself thinking that this isn\u00e2(TM)t a war epic but a bloody and action-packed account of his life. Yet, the storyline problem can be forgotten, because when the battles are the so immersive and action-packed, though not quite up to the high standards of sheer brutality shown in Saving Private Ryan, the battles alone make this film a hit. Taking everything into account, The Hurt Locker boasts a gritty, heart-pounding and intense portrayal of the Iraq War that whilst it doesn\u00e2(TM)t have a sufficient storyline or climax, is made up for with some rather sweet and satisfactory action and three enchanting performances.","525":"A film that seems to overstay it's welcome, dragging on with an unhindered plot it just leaves the viewer tired and restless near the end.","526":"One if not the best films dramatizing the war in Iraq","527":"A well executed war film that brings out the best from its actors and bursts out intense visuals from the cinematography. A destructive and fantastic film.One of the best movies of the year, with a star-making performance from Jeremy Renner.","528":"\"You'll know when you're in it...\" Kathryn Bigelow delivers an extremely bold and intense film. Definately not meant for entertainment purposes, this film is an in your face punch of the choas of war. In a desolate place where the enemy is practically invisible, anything or anyone could be a bomb or a bomber. This film gives the viewer an intense look at the choas of war in Iraq through the eyes of an elite bomb unit. A unit that faces death nearly every mission, a unit where split second decisions mean the difference between life and death. An incredibly gripping and emotionally charged film with excellent direction, and great acting by Jeremy Renner. The Hurt Locker won Best Director for Kathryn Bigelow, and Best Picture of 2009.","529":"Absolutely incredible.","530":"Intense and harrowing and very well acted, though the ending felt a little out of character to me; perhaps slightly too much bravado and certainty.","531":"worth watching... but meh...","532":"A cracker of a film. Easy to understand but hard to forget.","533":"Remarkable and addicting","534":"So I'm in Mary's Pizza shack enjoyin my rigottonni when out of the corner of my eye I see a man driving into the theatre parking lot. It was Tom Waits. So we finish our dinner and we go inside, It's Tom fuckin Waits again standing in line to get some popcorn then his girlfriend goes into the Hurt Locker. So the movie ends (cinematography is great, story focused on characters rather than political jargon, i love ralph fiennes and the guy from Mementos small role in it, it was great,,thanks ryan.) I go to the parking lot and I come to find out Tom Waits' car is parked right next to ours..so I just don't know what to do so I stupidly ask \"Are yoU..\" and he goes \"No..no..no..\" I guess he just didn't want to be bothered but it was pretty cool.","535":"Kathryn Bigelow really did a great job with this film, I'll be excited to see what she brings us in the future.","536":"Well acted, intense movie.","537":"I'm mesmerized by the special effects of The Hurt Locker's unforgettable action sequences, but disappointed in its minor lack of plot.","538":"Eye opening view of the Iraq war! Great story.","539":"Extremely well-made modern war film that made a star out of Jeremy Renner, and deservedly so! The ultra-realism approach to the battle scenes is unparalleled and keeps you on edge with suspense.","540":"The Hurt Locker is incredibly tense, with every tension filled moment supported by amazing acting and directing. One of the best films in recent years.","541":"Felt pushed on me due to it's length. Emotional and tense, but not Best Picture.","542":"The Hurt Locker keeps you on the edge of your seat with suspense that isn't contrived. Probably the most insightful film made about the Iraq war. Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty all deliver great performances.","543":"It is the first film I see from Bigelow, and right is the most critically acclaimed and fawned over by the audience, and really I am very surprised that this film answered all my questions about his \"victory\" in the awarding of the Oscars. His war story provides some tragic and dramatic moments and tense, action-packed scenes, resulting in the best representation of the war... in Iraq, because in general the best war film goes to \"Apocalypse Now\". His script is quite powerful, because it was written by Mark Boal, who has lived this experience and transmitted in a fictional story, and it is very well done in terms of the narrative of the story, as well as the dialogues that have their characters . The performance shows enough talent to enhance the characters assigned, especially Jeremy Renner who is (as I believe) the perfect role for him. I conclude by saying that the direction and execution of Katheryn Bigelow, is excellent for this kind of movies, she should keep doing work worthy of war and thriller hereafter. I must say that \"The Hurt Locker\" is an interesting piece of cinema, with very good performance and a specialized script, surprise (but worthy) to win the Academy Award.","544":"excellent performances. Stella direction. captivating throughout. tense start carried through the film.","545":"There is a scene in \"The Hurt Locker\", perhaps twenty or so minutes long, where Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), James (Jeremy Renner), Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) and the rest of the Bravo squad are engaged in a sniper battle with some Iraqi refugees.It's the best, most action-packed, and most epic battle I've ever seen in a movie, and none of the characters move more than three feet.This, we realize, must be how war is actually like. No running, and jumping and shooting and blowing or any of that. These slow, precise, suspenseful battles. How did they manage to get it so realistic?Well, it certainly helped director Kathryn Bigelow that her screenwriter, Mark Boal, was a war veteran. He knows firsthand what the deal is in Iraq and how to put it into a movie.The Hurt Locker's co-stars are Ralph Fiennes (we know him from his role as Voldemort), Guy Pearce (from L.A. Confidential) and Evangiline Lilly as James's wife. My favorite parts of the movie were when James's rebellious attitude clashed with Sanborn's by-the-book attitude, and while that seems like a cliche, it's presented in a different way in this movie.In one such scene, the team is about to blow up a building when James realizes he forgot his gloves at the bombing site. He grabs a truck and drives down to get them. As he's dancing around next to the bombs with the gloves in his hands, screaming, \"I found them!\", Sanborn's hand tightens around the detonator button. He is pushed to his limit.Bottom Line: The whole cast and crew actually flew to and shot the movie in Iraq, on location, and that couples with the experienced screenwriter make it easy to see how The Hurt Locker won the award for best picture.","546":"Loved this movie, felt pretty real. Very entertaining.","547":"The Hurt Locker is a movie about soldiers. It is not about war, nor is it a political statement. It is about 3 soldiers journey, how they view their duties as soldiers and life. There isn't a plot or bad guy. The story is about three soldiers and their experience. There is plenty of suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. The performances are very strong, especially Jeremy Renner as Sargent Willaim James. His performance is gritty and truthful. The supporting cast, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty, are equally good. The direction of the film is brilliant and it has some beautiful cinematography. It is a must see film. for people interested in good scripts, characters, and direction. If you are looking for something with a complex plot or lots of action, this isn't the movie for you. There is plenty of suspense and shooting, but it doesn't have the fast paced cutting normal war films have. Understand that there isn't an overwhelming amount of dialogue, but when there is it's well written and delivered beautifully.","548":"This is how war movies should be made...intense. The Hurt Locker is unlike any other movie. It brings realism and emotion to dark subject matter.","549":"The superb acting in this film does nothing to save it from its terrible pacing and embarrassingly crap ending.","550":"Greatest movie I have EVER seen.","551":"terrifying and deep close-up of personals of a drama war, love Jeremy Renner even more for his excellent performance","552":"I dont see why this won best picture but ok............","553":"Ihan ok, mutta ei mitenk\u00e4\u00e4n erityinen. Ei perinteinen sotaleffa miss\u00e4 olis toimintaa ja huumoria jne, enemm\u00e4nkin draama\/dokumentti tyyppinen kertomus yhden tiimin ja varsinkin yhden miehen el\u00e4m\u00e4st\u00e4 ja syist\u00e4 olla armeijassa.","554":"didnt like it,boring.","555":"never saw it might be cool","556":"A great film! I loved how they built tension, yet in the next scene you saw the soldiers playing with the local children. Renner did an AWESOME job as James! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is into war films, or if you're looking for a something different for a great drama.","557":"Right out the gate all the hype was high. \"One of the great war movies\" invites all viewers to come forth with certain expectations: Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, or whatever their favorite is. It' not all about hype, and since word of mouth can be often way off, sometimes it is dead on. When this movie was over I felt that I had missed something. Maybe I just didn't feel what I was supposed to. I can say it is not even in my Top 5 war movies. I named 3 of my five above, and Locker does not even begin to compare to these. It may sound as if I am dismissing this picture completely but that is not the case. I have allowed the messages and images to soak into my mind and over time it has grown on me more. This will have to viewed again because even though I can follow the adrenaline junkie bomb unit I still can't see what all the fuss is about.  Renner was definitely able to pull off a great role and he deserved his Oscar nom. I feel like we will see more great roles for him in the future. One of the last scenes is what made the whole experience worthwhile: the scene at the cereal aisle in the supermarket. I really hope Renner continues to pursues powerful roles like this. As far as direction goes, I also feel that Bigelow deserves her credit too. I think she has come a long way since her last good film (the entertaining Point Break) and has definitely brought her best work to light. Pierce and Fiennes bring various mixes to the project since they are pretty powerful as far as cameos go. All together is has a good lead role and the rest is pretty basic war drama. The story is brought to a boil over time and it has the potential to explode. When it didn't I was left to admire what I could.  I would estimate this is well above Jar Head but below even Black Hawk Down or We Were Soldiers. Maybe I'm the victim of hype because I'm standing almost completely alone on this one. It just didn't have the intensity I wanted and ultimately came up shorter than what I envisioned for it. ***After a 2nd viewing, I'm taking this up to a 4\/5 (80%). I still do not see this as a masterpiece war film but it does shine at times, particularly the last 15 minutes in my opinion. Renner stole the show.","558":"Wow, a really great look at possible mindset of soldiers I think that most don't have a death wish as much as a sense of commitment to their brothers in arms.","559":"The Hurt Locker is about a bomb squad in the middle east. When their lead bomb tech is killed they are sent a replacement (Jeremy Renner) who is a bit of a hothead and a bit wild. The movie then shows the squad in many various situations that work to show the brutality of the war and how hard it is for the soldiers to cope with.Things I Liked:Jeremy Renner. Renner showed he could helm a film here. His work is mesmerizing to watch during the entire movie. The performance grabs you from the moment you meet his character and you can't take your eyes off of him, whether he is acting opposite other actors or alone on screen. Renner proves, through Hurt Locker, that he is a compelling and highly watchable actor.The Tone. Holy cats, this movie is tense! The opening ten minutes alone have you on the edge of your seat and you get put back there throughout the film. The movie shows that war is not action packed, and exciting, it's tense, it's boring at times, it's hard to deal with, the movie parallels that beautifully, you really get a sense that these men are constantly in danger and something could take them out at any moment. The tone carries the movie, sometimes more than anything else.Things I Didn't Like:The Plot. I found the first hour of this movie really compelling and then everything after that to be a bit of a rehash and somewhat unnecessary. The movie feels long after the first couple of big moments. You start to lose interest, which is hard to believe given how gripping and tense the movie is, especially in the beginning.Overall:Overall, the movie is a tense, gritty, drama that really shows how tough the soldiers in the middle east have it. The starring performance from Renner is fantastic and he can hold your attention alone for an entire two hours, the movie manages to really capture the perpetual tension of being in a war zone and makes us as the viewers really feeling like something could go wrong at any moment. The movie gets repetitive and long during it's second half and you start to lose interest but the movie works well overall. It really keeps you on edge and by the end you just need to shake off and do something fun because of how it grabbed you.","560":"the best film of iraq war and also one of the best belic films i\u00b4ve ever seen","561":"Suspenseful, interesting, and hard to watch at some points. But an overall great movie with an excellent script and some excellent scenes.","562":"100\/100 my favorite movie","563":"Killed off guy pierce too quickly","564":"Good flick! One time stand though.","565":"If you didn't get enough torture and violence, ala Tarantino's Hostel, out of Zero Dark Thirty you'll surely want to watch The Hurt locker for more of it. After watching this film I must admit I couldn't help thinking if Ms. Bigelow's personal romantic life is heavily influenced by the works of the Marquise de Sade; I'm sorry that's the only thing I got out of this movie.","566":"I didn't see all of the hype. I thought this movie was just alright.","567":"Political films are never truly judged by its cinematic quality, Only by the quality of the script, which in this case a filth lie they try to feed us in order to justify the war upon innocent people. What soldiers feel, what their families suffer only count when you speak the honest words and the honest words only.","568":"With The Hurt Locker, I ended up watching a very different film than I intended to. The plan was to sit down and enjoy a dramatic war movie with nuanced performance and subtlety; an Oscar contender. By the end though, I was watching a high suspense thriller that happens to take place in Iraq. It's not an insignificant difference, and it was one I needed to make before I could fully appreciate what I was watching. Expectation is often the bane of a viewer's existence, and that's never more true than when one finally watches an Academy nominee. The film was released on June 26th and Oscar-buzz began shortly thereafter. Ever since then, our unformed opinions have been molded by everything BUT the movie itself. I hate this for a number of reasons, but mostly because it's unavoidable. Either see it opening day, or go live in a cave. Otherwise you had better be prepared to do battle with the forces of subjective opinion, because brother, they're a-comin.The story circles three men serving time in the Army, specifically in an Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit. After a chaotic opener in which Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) lose their team leader (Guy Pearce) to a remote detonated IED, we meet the anomalous Staff Sergeant Will James (Jeremy Renner), whose approach to the work is savant-like and troublesome to his new team. Sanborn and Eldridge are counting the days to their discharge, just over a month remaining for both. James just wants to disarm bombs. As the days pace slowly, the three men suffer a number of harrowing moments, often gruesome and just as often terrifying. For Sanborn and Eldridge these episodes are all just glimpses at death, and Eldridge in particular seems just one more loud noise away from losing himself entirely. The direction for Geraghty's performance might have been, \"war is hell, and you're always at war.\" James meanwhile, is always at a distance, seeming incapable of fear or even anxiety. It's apparent that he lives for the tension, that he thrives on it. Each bomb is another notch on the bedpost, and a calming cigarette usually follows a successful disarming. There's more to the plot, though I would hesitate to say it follows a story arch, more considering each characters path. Anyway, story is secondary to experience here.And experience seems nearly a character in this film. Occasionally we're thrust inside of James' protective helmet to see through his eyes and hear through his ears. It's claustrophobic and hot, and the drone of heavy breathing is a barrier to the sounds of the world. Sound isn't applied to scenes as much as it's painted in strokes. Occasionally the canvas is blank, just the muffled sound of city in the distance. Then swiftly we're immersed in the violent screams of battle and find ourselves longing for that silent tension. I would almost go so far as to say that director Kathryn Bigelow works better in short bursts than in constructing the whole. Though the film itself is vibrant, it's in shorter bursts that she seems most comfortable. Still, the script seems to account for this, with the story being told in something closer to vignettes than cohesive elements. The pieces speak to the whole, but don't necessarily define it.Most war movies are more or less about war. War is bad, war is heroic, war is chaos, etc. The Hurt Locker though seems to use war as just a setting. The action is familiar and the violence rivals any dramatic war film, but the point is not to examine war. The point is to examine fear. Watching this film you feel drenched in tension, with every scene comes a recognizable foreboding. It's familiar, though at first you can't decide why; there's certainly tension in war films, but this feels different. The strain of these scenes isn't just dramatic, but scary, and that's when the true nature reveals itself. This is a horror film. There's no abandoned old house, and most of the terror comes in daylight, but there's no mistaking this pattern of tension and release. You even find yourself wanting to scream at the characters, \"don't go in there!\" The camera reveals the film's most gruesome moments intimately, letting carnage play its role. This is without question a horror device, and adding to it the potential for truth in some of these ghastly moments, it's terribly effective. Most of us know the genre well enough to know you need some key elements. There is of course the character who's perpetually frightened, in our case Eldridge. There's Sanborn, the natural leader and obligatory good guy. And James, the character with some unnatural connection to the monster, an ambiguous, otherworldly kinship. Then there's the monster itself. The ghostly stalker of our main characters, casting its shadow of doom. In The Hurt Locker the monster is death, or fear of it.Aside from making a war movie something more than a war movie, Bigelow does a number of other things right. The cinematography is somehow both gorgeous and dirty, with the Iraqi landscape a haunting and captivating place. What occasionally feels like documentary footage can turn quickly into sublime photography, and it all serves the agitated arrangement. Her performances too are noteworthy, with not just a solid performance from Jeremy Renner, but really standout work from Anthony Mackie who seems to have gone entirely unnoticed. Towards the end of the film when Sgt. Sanborn finally breaks down, weary from the days and days after days and days, Mackie bursts through from the celluloid in one of the film's rawest emotional moments.Still, the film is not without jagged edges. While Renner's performance is good, it's also confused. His Sgt. James is initially a simple character with a complex motivation, but as the film rolls James has his moments of breakdown, just as everybody does, and to be honest, they fall a little flat. While I don't really need to see another character emotionally exhausted, I in particular want to avoid it with James, whose adrenaline junkie, fearless, cavalier persona is the perfect contrast to all the other war characters we're used to seeing. What makes him interesting is his disinterest, and by breaking that down the filmmakers seemed to lose direction a bit. Had James remained stalwart throughout, never feeling pain, never feeling loss, never feeling guilt, the character would have become the personification of wartime indifference. He still has these moments: when we recognize his only real drive is his next fix, or when he sheds his protective gear and states like an Eastwood character, \"If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die comfortable,\" but they're diminished by his fallibility, and the lost potential is frustrating.I suppose in general you could say that dialogue presents some small problems. Far too much happens on the surface here, patronizing the audience. I'm a firm believer in not placing a magnifying lens over your message or tying up your loose ends unless you absolutely have to. Nothing brings an eye roll like arriving at the point, then having to wait another thirty seconds for the film to arrive at it. I would name some examples of this within the movie, but it would feel a little defensive and unnecessary. Mildly trite dialogue is one of those things you either see or you don't, and unless it's terribly dramatic than it doesn't really hurt the final product all that much anyway.The inevitable question: Should this film win best picture? For my money I think Inglourious Basterds is the best film of the year. Possibly Up, and even Avatar feels like more of an accomplishment than The Hurt Locker. Certainly this film is good, with a moment or two that might transcend all others from 2009, but I just can't get behind a Best Picture win. I can't say for sure that my lack of enthusiasm might not be a byproduct of expectation, but I also can't do anything about it. I watched the same movie everybody else did, and this is what I thought about it. Stories, like characters, like themes, like images, like sounds, like songs, are fluid and given without explanation. This is the beauty of film, and perhaps too the burden. It's the x-factor and the element of the process you simply can't control. It's the reason the Academy Awards will, as always, be at least mildly frustrating. But it's also what makes the whole thing exciting and keeps it from being a science. It's the fickle charm of art.","569":"Amazing film! One of the best war films I've seen in a long time. It really brings you right into it and makes you feel as of you experienced it right with the soldiers\/characters. Loved it and didn't think I would as much at first ether. But I really, truly did. Jeremy Renner gives a stellar performance as the bomb disposal leader with a reckless and pretty much all the time fearless attitude towards his safety, and even those around him. I recommend this film to all, even if your not a big fan of war films, you'll enjoy it. As I did <333","570":"Really good film, very realistic, what a scary place to be, these are brave men that do this for a living!","571":"though the constant bomb disarming madness may get tiring for some viewers, bigelow does a tremendously good job of creating a very suspenseful and tense atmosphere. tries to utilize first-person pov cinematography at times but at least its not as bad as hunger games. nice cast, i enjoyed jeremy renner's comedic performance in the midst of all the warfare. probably one of the best war films about the iraq conflict. as a frequent watcher of war movies, i give it 4 and a half","572":"Great film...but Evangeline Lily only has her fifteen minutes in this film, so there is no reason to add her to the poster.","573":"A good movie if you have the right expectations. This is not a movie with a central plot point or a coherent narrative, it's a series of snapshots from certain operations in the U.S army. Some might saying boring, I'd say thought provoking.","574":"Nice movie, realistic to say the least. But I don't see why it was awarded an Oscar for best motion picture. There is no real storyline... It seems like its just life happening, an action packed life, mind you. The characters don't really grow or blossom, on the contrary we only get to know them better through out the story and still at the end they stay a complete mystery to the viewer. It was a long two hours for pretty much nothing. I won't be watching it twice that's for sure.","575":"This film felt short and it is a amazing in depth look at the life and death of bomb defusers.","576":"Some very intense scenes in the Hurt Locker but they are not surrounded by a central narrative.","577":"\u00e2Edge of your seat\u00e2? doesn\u00e2(TM)t even begin to describe the masterful way in which this film develops tension. It\u00e2(TM)s, by far, the best film about the Iraq War to date and has absolutely no political agenda. It SHOWS us, rather than TELLS us and leaves all the politics up to the viewer.","578":"War movie with tons of tension & suspense & heart","579":"A very well acted and gritty war movie, The Hurt Locker is great.","580":"I found it thrilling, but not among the best.","581":"This is a \"A-\" (90 marks) movie. (Blue-ray Disc) The first movie by Kathryn Bigelow who also directed the recent Dark Zero Thirty. This is a Iraq war movie seen through the eyes of the American soldiers. It is a great movie and it is for many critics worth more than 4 stars but since I don't really like the war, so 4 stars is the maximum from me.","582":"The best war movie out there","583":"Led by a breakthrough performance from Jeremy Renner, The Hurt Locker is wrought with tension, realism and brutal emotional realities, adding up to one of the 21st Century's greatest war movies yet.","584":"Kathryn Bigelow doesn't know much about character development.","585":"This movie shows a true meaning to suspense, war, and friendship. As James, Sanborn, and Eldridge become closer, the battlefield, becomes increasingly dangerous with terrorists, bombs, and civilians strapped with bombs. It will make you want to stand up and take a bow when it ends and will have you being for more.","586":"An often brutal, often beautiful insight into the middle-eastern conflict.","587":"The Hurt Locker is an impressive engaging, incredibly detailed and brilliantly written and acted war film that takes a perspective not seen before in other films like it. The action is thorough, frenetic and engaging so much that it holds the dramatic aspects of the film together so well. Jeremy Renner delivers a great performance amongst his very capable cast, and Kathyrn Bigelow is a mastermind of creating a gripping and suspenseful war thriller. Beneath it all is the political and social commentary on America's attitudes during the War on Terror that America needs to be shown. It is a solid epic of film and is my favourite war film to date.","588":"Talk about a movie that has you sitting on pins and needles all the way through it. Good movie!","589":"I didn't really understand what all of the hype was about but it was a fairly well-made film.","590":"A series of repetitive sequences of bomb removals, accompanied with bad acting and a horrible script","591":"It's amazingly well made and cleverly builds up great tension and suspense. The Hurt Locker is a great war film despite it's unrealistic elements.","592":"This movie was very well acted, it was very realistic, and it shows you a good perspective of the war in Iraq, but I don't think this movie lives up to its praise due to its lack if a narrative! sure these scenes are intense and interesting, but it didn't go anywhere. like honestly this is just a few guys running around, shooting Arabs and defusing bombs and that's it! Not impressed overall!","593":"This was a great movie that was able to show you just how hard and nerve-wrecking it would be to become a bomb technician in the Middle-East where an IED could be just about anywhere.","594":"The Hurt Locker is a masterpiece, a close to perfect war movie. It's shot in a way that captures every detail of war, and the job of bomb disarming unit, with tension and explosive impact. Kathryn Bigelow is one of the finest directors of this genre around. Jeremy Renner is my favourite actor, and that's why I was drawn to this film, along with support from Anthony Mackie, Guy Pearce and Brian Geraghty, the cast deliver unforgettable performances, they are so believable and they genuinely feel like actual members of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team. In the heat of the battle these 3 brave men risk their lives to disarm bombs in the Iraqi war. The suspense is surging, you are thrown into the deep end as the viewer and you have no idea what could happen next, within a split second the situation changes. I do admit in most movies I love explosions, the carnage leaves me jaw dropped, but in this movie you see the damage these things can do, and the lives they take, so that's why whenever a character was caught in a blast I threw myself out my chair in shock. Fantastically shot, brilliantly acted and filled with a tremendous amount of suspense and thrills, The Hurt Locker is a must see movie, think of every dramatic word from spectacular, amazing, awesome and that describes this film. A must-own in your movie collection and it rightfully deserved the awards it achieved. Mind blowing.","595":"Loses a star for migraine-inducing shaky-cam (which I HATE) and some surprisingly by-the-numbers characterizations. The performances are excellent, and the locations are well-chosen. Kathryn Bigelow also proves adept at building suspense that indeed comes close to unbearable at times. It's too bad that the photography and editing are so ugly to look at, and that they actually provoked literal nausea in this viewer. When will filmmakers understand that you don't need to shake the camera to generate tension or to make a film more believable?","596":"I really can't see what people admire in this film.. I think this movie wasn't anything special... ;\/","597":"The Hurt Locker (2008) - 8A film that portrays the precarious existence of a little Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in the Iraq war. Very well directed, excellent acting. Intelligent, thrilling and very raw (in all aspects) from beginning to end. It manages, in an interesting way, to lay bare how insignificant and vain can be the motivations that lead someone to submit itself to the distress of warfare. I'll have to watch this movie again as I feel that it has a lot more to absorb than I got in just 1 view, will probably rate it higher then. This and Kathryn Bigelow's most recent work, Zero Dark Thirty which I'd rate at least 9, share the same cinematic tissue, very raw and intelligent portray of real events, but they have a lot more under the surface, a lot more than a literal interpretation of what happens on the screen can unravel.","598":"Forced to play a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse in the chaos of war, an elite Army bomb squad unit must come together in a city where everyone is a potential enemy and every object could be a deadly bomb.Director: Kathryn Bigelow Writer: Mark BoalStars: Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty","599":"I'm gonna have to watch this one again. I'm not sure what I think about it.","600":"not bad, slightly on the long side. some intense moments","601":"Good but overrated. Well acted w\/ superb direction\/cinematography. A little slow though.","602":"a non-stop tense movie!","603":"A great modern war film with great acting by Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie. I loved the entire film.","604":"Only hurts if you watch it","605":"It's one of the best war movie I've seen. It's very realistic... I like the fact that the camera man is shaky all the time, it makes it look like the movie is being filmed by a war journalist or something.","606":"well done. And entertainment","607":"Probably, the most realistic visualization of the War in Iraq. I rate films out of 4 stars. (3.5\/4)","608":"I love Jeremy Renner","609":"wow... speaking of the film that has shock after shock after shock... this is one of those... the camera works is very good.. one of the best since children of men... ensemble cast did well... Pearce, Fiennes, Morse and Lily did well in playing their small parts... and most of all excellent command from the director.... perfect...","610":"I didn't think it was out of this world, but Jeremy Renner was perfect if you ask me. I don't like the idea of type-casting, but everyone plays one character best. This was perfect for him, and the movie was very, very well directed. I wasn't too high on Anthony Mackie and that's probably what ruined it for me.","611":"One of the greatest war movies ever made. It stands as how a war movie should be made, focusing on the characters and less on the action. There is action present and it is awesome but its Renner's performance that drives the film to new heights..","612":"finally saw The Hurt Locker. I really liked it. But I didn't love it.","613":"THIS FILM IS AMAZING (enough said)","614":"Highly suspenseful, finely detailed, and brimming with huge performances. Funny in the scariest ways possible. A great expose of the thrill soldiers get from war.","615":"A brutal view of the pointlessness of war, as told through the soldiers of the most pointless of wars. Watching a movie this raw can lead to the most heated of political discussions since it's hard not to have a harsh opinion if the reality of what these soldiers do are accurate and not overly Hollywood dramatized. Nevertheless, movies like this are not to be missed. The Hurt Locker shows that the art of storytelling through film doesn't require $250 million budgets to hit the viewer hard.","616":"Great timing, great camera, great direction, but anyway war will always be a shit.","617":"The Hurt Locker is a masterpiece, a close to perfect war movie. It's shot in a way that puts you in the front seat and captures every detail of war, and the job of bomb disarming unit, with tension and explosive impact. Kathryn Bigelow is one of the finest directors of this genre around. Jeremy Renner is my favourite actor, and that's why I was drawn to this film, along with support from Anthony Mackie, Guy Pearce and Brian Geraghty, the cast deliver unforgettable performances, they are so believable and they genuinely feel like actual members of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team.

I need more patience for this type of movie as I felt myself losing interest in it. Good moments, but too long.","619":"Easily the best war movie ever made. Hands-down. The direction is spectacular and the characters are memorable. 10\/10.","620":"intensely crazed bomb disposal expert, continually risks his teams lives for his love for disarming bombs","621":"This is a true white knuckle work of art film, with a ton of intense moments that will make you feel right there in the action.  The cinematography of the movie is fabulous, making it seem like a window into an actual war zone. The movie is quiet when it needs to be, and has the perfect music to go along with it, when it's the right time.  So why a 90%? They could have done a better job of developing the characters. The friendship between Sanborn and James (The two main characters)is well done, but slightly cliche and some of their conversations are predictable. However, at the end of the day, what they end up going through together is enough to make you care for the two.  The finest moments are near the end. With only a few days left in the squads deployment, it seems to all go south. The murder of a young Iraqi who James was close with and the failed attempt of relieving an innocent man from a locked bomb vest. However, the saddest part of the movie is his return home, and the Safeway isles filled with every cereal anyone could ever want. It does a great job of showing what it's like to be on the front line, during and after the fact.  As of December 2013, this movie secures my #1 spot of all time.","622":"Renner leads in one of the best modern war movies I have seen. This movie keeps you into it from start to finish.","623":"Best Picture of 2009, according to the Academy. It also won best director and best original screenplay out of the so called Big Five.I don't see it. I have no idea why this movie got so many awards, so many recommendations, so much critical praise. Is it a bad film? No, not at all. It's in fact rather good film, fully capturing the intensity of a bomb squad. I just wouldn't call it the best picture of the year, not even close.Still, it does some things very well. As stated, it is very intense from time to time. Every time one of the characters has to don on the bomb suit, the atmosphere picks up instantly. You can feel the claustrophobia, the detachment from the outside world, and I enjoyed those scenes very much. Most of the bomb situations are also creative and different enough to be interesting and I have to applaud the choice to film near actual war zone as it does add to the setting. It's a fine-looking film and the two sound-related Academy Awards were well-earned in my opinion.My biggest issues with this film lie with its characters. Director Kathryn Bigelow clearly tried to show us the detachment from reality that plagues these bomb squad members even outside their suits, but unfortunately I ended up being detached from them as well. I managed to form no connection with them, because none of them acted like a normal human being - at least in my opinion. They were there to illustrate a point, to act out the story and because they needed to be there, but they felt hollow and empty. At the end of the story I could say that I had enjoyed the scenery and some of the action scenes, but that I hadn't really learned anything new about war or its conditions.But perhaps that's just my failing as a viewer. Still, reviews are meant to illustrate the experiences of a particular viewer, and this one is mine. I don't particularly like this film. I can admire its vision and its professionalism, but it's not a film I would see twice or recommend to anyone.","624":"Good view on obsession on being on the battlefield, hurt by some unnecessary party scenes","625":"Staff Sergeant William James: There's enough bang in there to blow us all to Jesus. If I'm gonna die, I want to die comfortable. \"War is a drug\"A very intense war film by Kathryn Bigelow. In my opinion The Hurt Locker may have a little to much praise in my opinion, but it's still a really good war flick. The film has some tremendous cinematography and slick visuals, but come on best picture over Avatar? The story is painfully realistic and maybe the best dramatization of the Iraq War. It's kind of slow in parts, but it pays off due to it's suspense and well-acted performances by Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty along with some big names like Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes. The Hurt Locker is a good film war overall, but still people are overpraising it and it's not the best war film.","626":"The movie is good, but I'm not sure why it was deserving of the award for Best Picture.","627":"Amazing...The Hurt Locker has the sensibility and depth of an award winning film combined with second unit direction that would leave 90% of action films for dead. Tremendous action sequences that are explosive and always leave you on the edge of your seat.","628":"Very well-acted, and very intense.","629":"The Hurt Locker is a very entertaining and intriguing film. The entire cast all turn in performances that make this film worthwhile, but Jeremy Renner obviously is the performance that stands out. No doubt he has the most to work with in the film, but if you've seen his past efforts you know that he is worth the roles of this caliber. But film it's self seems like a mix of reality and fiction. I can understand that some of it is probably overblown or incorrect, and that seems to have put off some Iraq vets. But even so, we must remember that this is a film and not a documentary. So you have to expect some of that.  I don't think it's perfect... I do believe it hammers home the point that SGT. James is a thrill seeker. And there were a few scenes that I did not like. One about 3\/4 of the way through the movie where SGT. James leaves the base. It feels like a pointless detour to me. But overall it's a solid film that is worth your time, but I think the Best Picture hype is pushing things too far. This film is NOT as good as Inglorious Bastards. As a war film, it fits somewhere between Platoon and Black Hawk Down. In my opinion of course.","630":"A tense look at the different emotions\/physical travails of those who fought the terrorists in modern-day Iraq. The shaky camera work got pretty old pretty fast, though. Renner does great as an arrogant\/unsympathetic bad@$$. Could a soldier really have gotten away with being so reckless, though? And do soldiers really get \"addicted\" to war?","631":"I like war movies when they are done right, and this one is done right. What bugged me about it was the structure. It is aimless and I guess maybe thats the point but because of that I felt this movie really dragged on. There is realism in there and I guess thats what had me enjoy it and the intimacy in a war movie is a welcomed change. I wouldn't say it was great but its decent. All in all, I didn't feel for the characters and I guess thats what was missing for me. Heart.","632":"It shows what happens over there. You idiot diego . There is gonna be people exploding.","633":"Love this movie! It is in my top 5.","634":"Good movie. Intense and puts things in perspective of what our soldiers go through physically and mentally.","635":"amazing movie that I have been meaning to see. I had heard it was 'documentary' like, so I was surprised it had as much of a narrative as it did. Great acting. One of those movies that you fall asleep thinking about, and find yourself still thinking about when you wake up the next morning.","636":"Amazing from start to finish, Kathryn Bigelow's direction is so brilliant and its raw rugged realism packs a powerful punch. A standout compared to Avatar, it truly deserves its Oscar sweep.","637":"I was interested but not anymore lol","638":"Whats all this hype about..???didnt like it that much...low in action and High on publicity stunts..!!","639":"Realistic portrayal of the stresses a US Army bomb squad unit experiences while serving in Iraq. Well made. No name actors add credibility and give the feel like we are watching real soldiers.","640":"The Hurt Locker is far more than just an average \"war movie.\" Its cast - which includes the talents of Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty - deliver performances that drip with surprising depth and emotion. Kathryn Bigelow proves herself one of the best directors around, and the screenplay by Mark Boal is nothing short of brilliant. The film effortlessly switches from nail-biting sequences to heartbreaking ones, most notably the ending, which stands as one of my favorite endings in a movie to this day. My favorite movie of 2009 and one of the most memorable I've ever seen, The Hurt Locker is nothing short of a masterpiece.","641":"I can't help comparing this film to other war films I watched like Jarhead, Saving Private Ryan and Platoon.. This may not be the best but it is worth watching.. And it has an incredible cast.","642":"Intense. Fascinating. Engaging. I would not want to be in a bomb squad unit ever, but loved watching the drama of it.","643":"Deserved Best Picture far more than Avatar, but far from oscar worthy.","644":"Good acting. Mediocre story. Great suspense.2010 Movies: 16","645":"Despite the odd pacing, this movie is fantastic.","646":"Intense en rauwe Iraq-film die zich focust op het dodelijke ontmijningswerk van 3 centrale personages, de 'shaky' camera zuigt je mee in het moment, maar de rode draad ontbreekt waardoor het eindigt met een anti-climax","647":"The Hunt Locker - one word masterpiece","648":"A war story which almost dispaired me, I love that guy Jeremy Renner!","649":"One of my favorite movies of all time. This film spends over two hours capturing just one simple theme: war is a drug. It starts off slow, and speeds up when necessary. Jeremy Renner's performance is also brilliant. The thing to note is that this is not an action\/adventure movie. It is a slow drama about the toll war takes on people.","650":"Well acted and well shot. Not a lover of thrillers, so tension really more felt like boredom. In one scene there was clearly a crew member's hand in the shot. I guess Jeremy Renner wasn't capable of walking through a plastic curtain himself... I feel like Hawkeye could've managed with the crew member, though.","651":"Once again I think my bias might leave a bitter taste in my mouth regarding some of the questionable encounters these EOD techs had in this film, however the acting of Renner and Mackie more than make up for it. The story is gritty and harrowing, with a touch of hyperbole, yet worth the watch.","652":"Zaj\u00edmav\u00fd film o pyrotechnic\u00edch, ob?as to sklouzne k hollywoodsk\u00e9mu patosu, ale jinak se mi to celkem l\u00edbilo.","653":"This film is for rednecks. It is totally unrealistic and cliche. The main character, William James, is a maverick (which Americans admire) who disobeys orders, endangering his own life and the lives of those around him. His attempts to single-handedly win the Iraq war by taking on insurgents alone is no different from every other cheesy action film in which the 'hero' takes on an army of villains. The film is an appalling celebration of melodrama and a poor attempt to compare the Iraq war with Vietnam.","654":"Very good, but I thought avatar should have one the Oscar that year","655":"The Hurt Locker paints a one-ended war where nobody wins, lives are lost left and right from countless different causes, and soldiers aren't driven with pride so much as they are with adrenaline, as proposed by Jeremy Renner's character, James, who diffuses active bombs on the battlefield. The film is extremely intense and entertains without remorse and surely deserves its awards.","656":"Traduction merdique.... Apr\u00e8s il y a un film puissant aux images saisissantes. Adr\u00e9naline et suspense d'une rare efficacit\u00e9... Derni\u00e8res images un peu d\u00e9cevantes. Fort bon film de qualit\u00e9 dans la lign\u00e9 de JARHEAD, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN et FULL METAL JACKET","657":"Bigelow's style of film making is something is totally amazing","658":"I loved how it opened, as I didn't think something would happen to a big name like that so fast!Renner is great and it actually showed how these guys get so used to doing jobs like these in war, they really can't function in a normal life without it.That being said there is little emotion here, and you don't really much care if the characters are killed or not.I wish there had been more scenes with Lilly, as I loved her on LOST and she's barely a cameo here.The bomb scenes are pretty intense.","659":"Gritty, Emotional, Thrilling picture of human turmoil","660":"The Hurt Locker lacks a story, but it is a heavy examination in the junkie adrenaline man Jeremy Renner who plays a man that has an addiction to defusing bombs. It's nail biting suspense with a different perspective on war.","661":"A perfect and realistic view into the life of an American soldier.... Moving and emotional","662":"Boring hyped up way to waste about 4 hours of your life.","663":"Renner gives a performance to remember. A soldier that loves the battlefield more than his family, a man who is fearless in the war zone, because of that, his sanity becomes questionable.","664":"The best film of 2009.","665":"On very rare occasions, you get a war movie that lets you enter the atmosphere of a war zone that gets your heart racing and lets you engage yourself. Kathryn Bigelow gives her crowning jewel of a movie, showing the power and turmoil of the Iraqi war. No special effects, no replicated set pieces, nothing fake about it. The action was real, the explosions were authentic, the acting was incredible, the suspense was amazing, everything about the movie was incredible. This is clearly the best movie Kathryn Bigelow has to offer.","666":"This movie is my watermark for anything else I watch, characters are superbly developed, the acting is brilliant....it has some violence\/gory bits...but it is not over the top, they are relevant to the situation. I have spent months\/years looking for something that comes close, there are a couple, but they are few and far between.","667":"I enjoyed the tension, the use of slow motion, and the subtle criticism of both war and machismo.","668":"One of the best war movies ever. Starting a flawed yet heroic protagonist.","669":"The Movie is absolutely flat, don't know if is bad action, bad drama or really bad comedy.","670":"Very intriguing film","671":"I don't like using the word 'perfect' around films, but I'm pretty comfortable with using 'perfect' and 'The Hurt Locker' in the same sentence.","672":"Man this movie is beyond intense. With a sense of spectacular realism, undeniably crazy tension, and acting that makes the movie feel like a documentary, this is a classic. It chronicles a unit that disarms bombs in the middle east...The EOD. Their lives are at risk every day and Jeremy Renner is at the helm; he plays a cocky no nonsense soldier who does not fear death. He will challenge orders, but he's damn good at what he does. The scenes are harrowing and the realism is point on. The tension is so deep you are constantly wondering if these men are going to die. A brilliant screenplay, mixed with flawless acting make this a classic war movie that ranks up with the best of them.","673":"A very exciting war film. I don't think EOD Specialists have their role in the Middle East appreciated enough. A film about true heroes and will definitely watch again and again!","674":"Extremely well-acted, \"The Hurt Locker\" shows the war like never before. Both Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie did an amazing acting job showing the two different personalities of their characters, one very serious and one that doesn't play by the rules and takes risks, However as we follow a bomb-defusing team it seems all too repetitive, I felt like I knew that every time they would survive. But I liked the fact that they steered away from the main plot and talked about the suicide bomber that \"wanted to live\", or how Jeremy Renner's character thought that Beckham died (the young boy that bonded with him). When I found out that Beckham was alive, I felt happy but I also understood how Jeremy Renner's character was upset that he had gone through all that trouble when he thought he had died. I think the acting and writing was amazing, and I also loved how Kathryn Bigelow made the movie seem realistic in the way that there were no musical cues letting us know that the character was alright because that doesn't happen in a war, in a war you are always fearful of dying, there are no theme songs, music or other cues in real life. The movie was spectacular with visuals; they had great shots of bombs exploding in slow motion. I thought movie was well done and well thought through. Overall I feel that the movie deserves 6 out of 10 stars.","675":"Definitely deserved to win best picture, I feel like this movie gets the feel of being in Iraq the closest to real life, the movie is just non stop suspense, Jeremy Renner is such an awesome actor!","676":"Incredible. 9.3\/10. A.With interesting characters, realistic dialogue, fantastic direction, brilliant editing, and far above-par performances, The Hurt Locker is an immensely effective film that draws (and places) you right into the action.","677":"Kathryn Bigelow's brilliant, episodic war thriller is a superb portrait of war and one man's drug-like addiction to the adrenaline rush it gives him. Jeremy Renner's central performance is outstanding, and Anthony Mackie's brilliant Sgt. Sanborn counterbalances him. Bleak and virtually plotless, The Hurt Locker is a very unusual Best Picture winner, but it's one of the best of its decade. A true powerhouse.","678":"After losing their team leader in an explosion two members of a bomb squad must work with his replacement and try to survive the final 39 days of their tour in Iraq.Katherine Bigelow brings us the best war movie of this Generation; The Hurt Locker follows three members of an elite bomb squad who are called out to clear IED?s out of the way for their fellow soldiers. It is a tense game of cat and mouse not knowing who is placing the bombs, how they are going to be detonated or how much time they will have to defuse them before an insurgent remotely detonates them. Jeremy Renner delivers a phenomenal performance as Staff Sergeant William James the new team leader who appears reckless and without care for his team. The inside look into what motivates these volunteers to join a bomb squad and perform one of the most dangerous positions in the army is simply astounding the combination of going into an unknown area against and unknown enemy and defusing these crude bombs will make you squirm in your seat as if you are there. The shot?s of the concussive blast from one of these bombs is visually amazing. The dynamic of Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Eldrige (Brian Geraghyt) who are counting down the days to leave Iraq conflicting with James who has defused hundreds of bombs and is not looking forward to leaving Iraq like the other two creates a mesmerizing conflict. The brotherhood they share as well as the discomfort of putting their life on the line in one of the deadliest situations possible is exhilarating to watch.With a great cast and excellent direction the Hurt Locker is a movie that everyone should see, especially given that this is a film that is based in reality, on situations taking place right now.","679":"Have to say this, really disliked this one...truly bad best pic win....obviously most people saw something I did not.","680":"This is hands down the most overrated film I have ever seen. This is a good movie, but not BEST picture by any stretch of the imagination. There a few major problems I have with this movie. It doesn't have a great plot structure and is just WAY TOO SOFT! That sniper scene is disgraceful! If someone gets shot in the neck, even with a sniper, they aren't going to drop dead instantly (Don't believe me? watch the Zapruder film). This movie makes death clean and nice, which it isn't! If we are going to take war seriously, I want to see someone bleed out, go into shock, or suffocate like they would in real life. The great war films never shy away from blood and gore. Bigalow says Kubrick inspired her, but this was no Full Metal Jacket. Full Metal Jacket was gnarly, people got shot and suffocated in their squad mates arms. Squad mates tried tirelessly to revive friends who were already too far gone. This movie had none of that! I absolutely went ballistic when the British guy on the Humvee l got shot and everyone accepted that he was dead without having any possible way of knowing!! How on earth do they know he isn't alive! Good movie but will never be to comparable to Saving Private Ryan (which didn't win best picture despite being almost unanimously considered a better movie than the hurt locker), Full Metal Jacket, and Apocalypse Now. Ultimately Bigalow tries to show us war, but fails to SHOW war in the blood messy reality!","681":"A well-acted action filled war epic!!","682":"Ruthless and very episodic. It is addictive and demands rewatches. Excellent.","683":"This is without a doubt, hands down, the worst movie I've ever seen. The real story of this movie takes place outside of the movie, and it is a tragedy, a sincere tragedy that the general public is so intensely naive about what war is like, that they considered this a good movie. I have been in the Army now since 2005, and since then I have yet to find a team of EOD techs who run around Iraq aimlessly by themselves on cool guy secret missions. I also have yet to find anyone in the military who thought this was a good movie, in fact, a majority of people I know found this movie insulting due to its completely idiotic plot. Then again, what do we know, we're actually in the military.","684":"An Outstandingly directed, written and acted film. An intense, gripping war story. The Hurt Locker is arguably the greatest war movie of all time","685":"Every time i see this i attempt to see the attraction, but the simple fact is: it's just boring and no character has any charisma or likeability","686":"Intense & gripping but lacks narrative","687":"Deserved to beat Avatar by a mile...a very long mile","688":"Finally just finished watching 'The Hurt Locker', which unfortunately once again is a movie that is more than a little bit relevant in the wake of the newest bombing. As a critic put it, this movie: \"Combines white- knuckle tension, sizzling dialogue and poignant insight into the lives of the bravest guys in Baghdad.\" and I thoroughly enjoyed it, even if I half covered my eyes through the most suspenseful parts of it.. haha.","689":"The first Iraq war movie I've seen. Tremendously realistic (I'd imagine), throughout the movie I was always with the actors in Iraq. It tells the story of Sgt James, a bomb disposal officer addicted to adrenaline.","690":"\"GREAT FILM MAKING AT IT'S BEST\"","691":"Perfectly combining and balancing tension and witty charm, \"The Hurt Locker\" is bursting with plenty of action, humor and brilliant emotion all of which being excellently well rounded from great performances from the film's leads.","692":"This movie is full of historical, tactical, and factual errors. The idea behind it was good, but the lack of military research makes it impossible for me to enjoy.","693":"It may have some incredible and suspenseful moments but it feels disjointed and lacking in its entirety.","694":"Kathryn Bigelow's \"The Hurt Locker\" is a thrilling human interest story exploring motivation in the era of industrialized military adventurism.Framing voluntary continued participation in war as an addiction brings to light a method of maintaining sanity that has not been frequently explored in a serious war drama thus far. In a post-Vietnam era war where the U.S. military doesn't exactly know who the enemy belligerents are, i.e., it could be everybody or nobody, thrill seeking is as good a way as any to artificially maintain an even keel. The improvised explosive devices exacerbate that problem. Any object could be a bomb. Having a faceless enemy elevates the question of just why, exactly, were we fighting a war in Iraq. Who was the enemy? What was the real objective?Jeremy Renner's character SFC James' unconventional approach to war is highlighted by his Bravo Company partners, who take more typical approaches to the situations they find themselves in. Anthony Mackie's SGT Sanborn is a man who sees the value in sticking to the military structures that SFC James interprets a little loosely and Brian Geraghty's SPC Eldridge has lost much of the insulation protecting his nerves from the constant onslaught of life-endangering situations. As a result, they have slightly more functional difficulty with war than their team leader. This difference in approach also makes for some situational humor spurred by SFC James. Though it may feel like a humorous vestige of the civil society the soldiers grew up in, the recurring placement of the habitual nicety \"please\" is reflective of the artifice (questionable integrity of and shallow justification) of the whole Iraq situation. SFC James is a rogue technician in a rogue war in a formerly rogue middle eastern state. In this particular situation he is the normal one, not his more tentative team mates.Though that's not to say he doesn't have an arc. There is one iconic, but unsubtle scene where he showers after a mission with all his gear on. One can feel that the man wishes, in this moment, that the water would rinse away the weight of mistakes made, in addition to the blood that leaches off. The strength of Renner's performance as SFC James makes me want to see more of that character, which is unlikely because this isn't a popcorn film like \"The Bourne Identity\" or \"Casino Royale.\"For this story, war mostly takes place in a medium density arid urban setting, rather than a continental countryside or a jungle somewhere in the global south. For each IED that Bravo Company attempts to disarm, whether successful or not, there is an audience. Folks of many walks tune into the grotesque magic shows now performing in the Baghdad public square. Will the magician disappear? Will the puppet master delight again?What makes this film so thrilling, in addition to being an engaging drama, is the expert depiction of urgent escalation and suspense. Using very effective cinematic techniques, Bigelow binds the audience to a fluctuating roller coaster of dread and immense tension. The editing and stylish speed manipulations help transport the audience to wartime Baghdad. The action that takes place and the visuals presented carry a wrenching visceral quality, translating the often remote brutality of war to the human body, in varying intensities and degrees of life endangerment. The pacing is pretty tight as well, responsibly toying with the audience's breath.The blend of fidget-cam and completely static shots is modulated to the intensity of the action on screen. It's still and clear when the characters have the luxury of precise examination and shaky and shallow in situations where they don't. Unlike other films that use constant camera shake to lend \"authenticity or grit\" constantly, as a baseline, this film uses it to obscure details for the audience when those same details are obscured for our characters by escalating situations. The constant assessment of where to focus your attention so that you might to fight another day translates perfectly.The production design is excellent and never looks cheap (to my lay eye). The weaponry and equipment used looks darn authentic. It lacks the plasticky\/summarized look that many throwaway action films, with much larger budgets I might add, have. The suit that SFC James wears looks like the real deal, sweltering in the desert sun.Kathryn Bigelow's Peckinpah-ish chutzpah finally yielded Oscar gold with this film. She has portrayed macho men doing ridiculous things before, but didn't break through to critical adoration until now. Just as brilliantly written as \"Inglourious Basterds,\" not in terms of dialog, but in terms of symbolism and historical encapsulation and easily a rawer and less tried and true a story than Avatar, \"The Hurt Locker\" definitely deserved its Oscar for Best Picture, despite all the grumbling afterward. Mark Boal's highly detailed and satisfying script is a perfect compliment to Kathryn Bigelow's artful spunk. As a result, the film is an interesting hybrid of a ballsy and entertaining action film and a serious emotional drama focusing on a select group of people in some of the most intense situations possible. The film might not be perfectly realistic per se, but it feels completely true in terms of the parts of the human emotion spectrum it covers. Then again, criticizing a fictional film for its inaccuracy is like criticizing a painting for not being photorealistic. Interestingly, it feels much less Hollywood than \"Platoon,\" which, 26 years later, feels more like a counterpart to \"Predator\" than \"Apocalypse Now.\" Though it may not be as triumphant as Francis Ford Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now,\" \"The Hurt Locker\" is just as fitting a portrayal of the Iraq conflict, finding the elusive sweet spot between visceral intensity, intelligent writing, and a resonant topicality that stops well short of the preachiness that is so easy to fall into.As a man and his addiction come into focus, a current sense of our military-industrial complex follows suit. (15 January 2013)","695":"A movie that attempts to sell itself in a realistic military setting, but is anything but realistic. The writers\/director clearly either don't care what happens in real war scenarios, or are just completely ignorant. It also became very predictable as the movie continued. Halfway through the movie I found myself laughing at it numerous times as if I was watching any other B-movie.","696":"No real main storyline that moves the movie along.","697":"A US army bomb disposal tec makes waves in his new unit because of his gung ho attitude. The Hurt Locker is an interesting war film, mainly because its indie sensibilities make it a very unusual treatment of this subject for a product of the US movie making industry. It's quite a reserved, unsentimental film about the impact of a \"war\" that has no visible enemy; not quite in the same way as Jarhead in which the soldiers just could not find an army to face, but because the enemy hides itself in plain sight amongst the innocent population. This obviously causes great conflict within the soldiers, always unsure whether to fire or not to fire and seemingly never able to punish the perpetrators of the atrocities they witness on a daily basis. It thankfully avoids heavy-handed patriotic bullshit instead concentrating on the effects of the situation on each individual and the fine performances all round make for fascinating character study. The \"battle\" sequences are also very well staged, and although the dreaded shaky cam did irritate (the constant zoom switching and miscued shots are so obviously deliberate that it just made it feel even more fake rather than less) it is technically very accomplished on every level. The only faux pas for me was the closing scene in which \"our hero\" is striding purposefully back down a Baghdad road to a heavy metal riff which was a bit too John Wayne and seemed to be at odds with the tone of the whole of the rest of the film, but otherwise another quality war film about a very sensitive subject.","698":"A...MA...ZING. The movie isn't anything I've ever seen. The movie gave a wonderful sample on what the soldiers had to go through. Hands down one of the best war movies I've seen. :)","699":"I was never a fan of war movies, I've always been very picky with that theme. I've got to admit I had a lot of expectations for this one because of all the acclaim it got, but honestly I wasn't very much entertained or touched by it except for the last 10 minutes of the movie. I think it's quite subjective, so I'm saying this at a subjective point of view of someone who's not into war movies.","700":"Overhyped,overated dross...bomb disbosal experts show the elite S.A.S how it`s done, ha ha only in american eyes!","701":"The first thing I saw Jeremy Renner in and he really impressed me. I also thought the message of the film was pretty unique and the bomb diffusing scenes were really, really tense and well done.","702":"This movie was entertaining, and the first time you watch it you really feel the pressure\/suspense. The pure grittiness of it captures the horrors of war, but other than defusing some bombs there wasn't really anything to special about this film. I loved the action, character development, and story but this film is missing the typical 'sacrifice\" mindset that make most military movies so special.","703":"Ok, good story, but slow in some parts.","704":"\"The Hurt Locker\" will mold itself into the category of one of the greatest war movies of all time. It is arguably the most intense action film in the history of cinema. As of this date, it has won best picture at the Oscars, a title well deserved. It is the best live action film of 2009. And it is the second best movie of 2009 behind the documentary \"Tyson\". \"The Hurt Locker\" is director Kathryn Bigelow's fresh take on a military profession that is not based upon typical cliche, \"front-line\" gun battles. The film focuses on soldiers who are in charge of disposing roadside bombs; a job equally as important as any within the military. \"The Hurt Locker\" stars Jeremy Renner, a bomb disposal expert who lives vicariously through his job. He lives life in accordance with the theme of the film which states that \"war is a drug\"; a very interesting idea about soldier mentality that has never really been explored in war films. At times he is cartoonishly wild and unpredictable in his methods, forcing co-star Anthony Mackie to try and hold his unit together on a 40 day tour of Iraq. Mackie wonderfully plays the straight man to Renner's loose cannon. The two are in conflict with each other, yet at the same time are surrounded by the hell on earth that is the Iraq War. Their co-existence is key to their survival and to the survival of their unit. War movies are mostly praised for their realism and \"The Hurt Locker\" is the most realistic portrayal of war that I've witnessed since the opening scene of Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\". We get an accurate glimpse of how intense and scary modern warfare really can be. This film is gripping and unpredictable. It is well acted and great to look at. At times you forget that it's a movie, it feels like your watching something more along the lines of a documentary. For example, no performance feels like a performance, the acting is that good. \"The Hurt Locker\" is a real achievement in film making and is such a leap above and beyond the crapfest of movies made in 2009. I take my hat off to Kathryn Bigelow who made a beautiful modern war epic that will stand the test of time. I would have given this film a perfect rating but I felt the film got really bumpy in its closing sequences and I wanted a bit more in the department of character development. Though you can never really have it all unless your watching \"The Godfather\". \"The Hurt Locker\" is a must-see movie, the only must-see of 2009. Grade: A-","705":"Should be Titled \"The Foot Locker\"...because that's where anyone associated with this film should be working now.","706":"Exceptional, Jeremy Renner at his finest.","707":"excellent performance by Jeremy Renner a must see!","708":"This is an intense movie to watch. It was good but I found that I had problems staying focused on the film because some parts were just so uninteresting. Renner is outstanding in this film. My heart just broke for his character. It was a good piece of work in that it showed the audience the plight of the wartime soldier. The movie does not have a real conclusion but I interpreted that from the director that these soldiers never get a conclusion to the horrors they witnessed. Everyone should see this movie and really appreciate the cost of war on these military men\/women and how grateful we all should be that we do not live in a war torn country.","709":"What are you gonna do if you're sure you're gonna die anyway?","710":"Amazing way drama with powerful performances and a brilliant score.","711":"On one level, this is an intense two-hour commentary on a quotation from war correspondent Chris Hedges: \"The rush of battle is a potent and often lethal addiction, for war is a drug.\" On another level, it's a metaphor for the addictive quality of violence in general -- a phenomenon that has produced what Pope John Paul II called a \"Culture of Death.\"This is a hard movie to watch, but I'm going to be recommending it. Violence, all violence, is depraved and revolting. Pray for peace.","712":"87%Watched this film on 27\/05\/2013Hurt Locker is clearly one of the best films from director Kathryn Bigelow and it is the only film of her other than Point Break that I have seen. The Hurt Locker is tensely shot and well acted. Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie are great actors and you can occasionally see big guns such as Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce. One of the best shot scenes in the film is the opening scene where a grenade explodes when it is triggered by a cell phone. There is this awesome slow motion scene during that explosion, it is mind blowing. Hurt Locker is one of the best Iraq War dramas from Hollywood. Also there is a sniper shooting scene in the film which is extremely interesting and tense. The scene where Jeremy Renner detonates a series of bombs kept on the back of a car is a really tense situation.  Hurt Locker has some disturbing scenes such as a bomb inserted inside the body of a dead boy. I recollect an incident that occurred in India when Maoists killed Indian soldiers and stuffed their bodies with bombs. Bombs were surgically inserted into the soldier's bodies. The report was that the Maoists take inspiration from Hollywood movies. Anyway, the suicide bomber was scene was a big letdown and from there the film fails to get momentum and tension from there on. I don't really know what else I have to say about this film, so I am winding up.","713":"Well acted and incredibly intense","714":"I could not get into this, I blame the advertising and everyone around me talking about the ending. My rating would probably be higher if I went into this movie cold. From where I sit, Avatar should have won best picture instead of this, and I recognize that Avatar had some major issues. I like what this movie was trying to do, but I think it failed to make the protagonist likable, which pulls the whole movie down","715":"Wow. How much more Hollywood can you get? The Hurt Locker is a beloved and critically acclaimed movie that is regarded as the best Iraq war movie. Those critics obviously know nothing about the Iraq war. Where to begin? Well I'll start with the positives. The film is very atmospheric. The landscape looks just like Iraq. I felt thirsty just watching it. The acting is amazing, and the film can be quite entertaining. That being said, this had to be one of the most unrealistic and disrespectful war films I've ever seen. Jeremy Reiner's character displays soldiers as hot headed thrill seekers. Seriously, they would never let someone that reckless in the army. There's a reason the army is strict, that strictness saves lives! This dude is unreal. I mean please, the scene where he leaves his base without permission, breaks into a civilian's home, then moves back across Iraq at night and makes it back to his base unscathed? Get real. Come on, endangering his soldiers lives, assaulting civilians, leaving his post? How is this guy still in the military?! And don't even get me started on the sniping scene. Really? A group of soldiers roaming Iraq by themselves with no authority? Get real. An Iraqi soldier getting two one hit kills while sniping with an AK? Get real. This movie is Hollywood's version of the war. It's a complete spit in the face to the men and women of our army. It makes them look like smug, cocky thrill seekers when in reality, they're brave people doing a very difficult job. It lacks tension, credibility, and it's main character is so unlikable you can't wait to see him die. Will someone please tell me how this movie won best picture?","716":"I liked the story and the tense moments of the film but wasn't the biggest fan of the cinematography and how it always seemed to bounce around a lot and never stayed clear. overall a good film but just a few nitpicks I had problems with","717":"Not another war movie, please! There was nothing about this movie that appealed to me. Too realistic for my liking. AAW. 1001","718":"Aside from one useless plot meandering,, an excellent film which makes you appreciate the unique horror and excitement of this type of combat. The scene in the cereal aisle is brilliant-a tremendous contrast to what the viewer and character have experienced prior.","719":"Well acted, intense, and featuring some of the best direction of the decade, The Hurt Locker is a wonderfully tense war film.","720":"Many suspenseful and powerful scenes, very credible and not overwrought with emotion.","721":"One of the best war movies I have seen in long, long time and one of the best movies of 2009! Not so much a deep plot but a point that certain people where made for certain ways of life. Wonderful character driven and visually stunning to watch. I found myself not being able to take my eyes off the screen until the end...not because it was a amazing, but that the story had grabbed me and I had to see where the main character, Staff Sergeant William James was going within the story. Its that good. I highly recommend this movie on all levels!","722":"Why did this movie get so much praise?","723":"A good film, let down by a woeful ending.","724":"This is a really good film. Jeremy Renner's performance is what makes this film. Guy Pearce is in it too. I liked it because it doesn't take a side pro or anti war. You can just watch this and not get any political overtones like most wartime movies take.","725":"The best motion picture that excels at every possible angle. Unparallelled experience.","726":"This is a really, really good film.","727":"The Hurt Locker has a few very, very good scenes, scenes I haven't seen before or that were done in an interesting, original way. But those were all in the final 45 minutes, and there were far more long, uninteresting combat scenes where I had to fight VERY hard to stay focused on the story. A large part of this is a genre prejudice, I admit, but war movies have overcome that before and been very touching for me (Saving Private Ryan being the most recent example). The Hurt Locker just doesn't offer enough, certainly not to justify it as a Best Picture winner.","728":"Very entertaining from start to finish.","729":"Two words: Jeremy Renner.","730":"good movie really tense and nerve shattering, I imagine that is the idea given the subject matter. but great performance from Jeremy Rimmer.","731":"Great movie, I love the action and rebellious of a character that Jeremy Remmer plays in this film. Love it!","732":"THE HURT LOCKER is a amazing, gripping, suspenseful, thrilling, war drama that is a fantastic film. It's set in the war of Iraq a few years ago and shows what the soldiers have to go through to disarm explosives and fight for our country. War is a drug. The Hurt Locker does have many great things to give you. There are a few scenes where a soldier has to disarm a lot of bombs and explosives. It's very suspenseful and puts you on edge. You never know if he's gonna blow up or not. And there is a awesome scene were two groups of snipers shoot at each other. That scene was awesome. This movie is VERY realistic. Strangely though there wasn't a whole lot of blood. The way this movie is filmed is great, because it's presented more like a documentary then a actual movie. And there is no music in the background whatsoever which makes the bomb disarming scenes even more suspenseful. The acting is great and Jeremy Renners character is a funny, witty character that you hope doesn't die.The Hurt Locke is a fantastic movie that gives you a sense of how tragic and terrible war really is. War is a drug, and so is this movie. From start to finish, it's a masterpiece","733":"A well executed war film that brings out the best from its actors and bursts out intense visuals from the cinematography. A destructive and fantastic film.","734":"This is a wild man movie! Although it can't help but feel episodic, the ending ties it all together beautifully. It's a masterclass in tension and suspense, directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who's easily one of the best action directors that ever lived (see Point Break... no joke, see Point Break).","735":"Pretty good movie...more realistic warfare. Not as much action as I was wanting though.","736":"Nerve-rattling immersion into the last 39 days of a tour of duty for a three-man American bomb squad stationed in Iraq. An onscreen quote opens the film proclaiming \"War is a drug\" and spends the next 2 hours with a single-minded purpose of explanation. What it does, it does very well, giving a first-person perspective into the variety of dangers that these soldiers encounter every day. There's no sermonizing about war, just a very matter-of-fact approach which is rather novel. However some of the connecting material between encounters is a little weak for a Best Picture winner, giving the movie's structure the feel of an intense video game. Jeremy Renner is a quality find as a foolhardy detonation expert. Kathryn Bigelow's shakycam directorial style is both an asset and a hindrance, as if she doesn't have complete mastery of her tools. Admittedly she too won a statue for her work, but I can think of a handful of other women more deserving of landmark Oscar recognition.","737":"Okay so here's the second movie that I was borrowing from my youngest brother along with Gladiator. So without further intro, let's get into The Hurt Locker.  Plot: Sergeant First Class William James becomes the leader of a Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit during post-invasion Iraq after the units former leader was killed by a bomb. Throughout the film, the other members of the unit, Sanborn and Eldridge become concerned about James because his methods in how he does his job as they try to find and disable or destroy bombs, and encounter other missions and danger in Iraq.  This was a very well done war movie. And I actually have a friend who was in the military who has told that this movie really hits it pretty accurately with the war in Iraq. It really displays the suspenseful things that soldiers out there face out there with the hard relationships between the troops and the Iraqis, how hard some of the choices they make can haunt them, and altogether trying to survive long enough to go home. The actors really do an extremely good job at giving us these characters and what each one of them goes through throughout the movie.  Actors\/Characters Jeremy Renner\/Sergent James: James was a very interesting character. He did have an interesting sort of 'I prefer my own way' kind of methods with disabling or destroying bombs, and I especially liked his line \"If I'm gonna die, I want to die comfortable.\" But he did have his more serious side where he was determined to get the job done and he did really care for his unit and some times was dramatized about some pretty harsh stuff that was happening and Renner displayed all of that really well which makes it little surprise that he was nominated for Best Actor at the oscars and has make a breakthrough in his career since this movie.  Editing: I particularly liked the editing from the first scene of this film. Mostly because during one editing class I took at film school a couple of years ago, the teacher showed that particular scene and roughly took it apart and showing how every since choice of shot and time of cutting from one shot to another worked really well and I liked how much sense that makes even watching it not sometimes.  And that's my review for The Hurt Locker. It's an excellent Iraq war film that displayed a lot of things that happened around that time with very well made and acted characters that makes it probably the best Iarq war movie ever made.","738":"If they would've sold it as \"Minesweeper - the Movie\". Everyone would hate it jsut like \"Battleship\"...","739":"Seriously, one of the best war films I have seen nowadays. Defiantly a worthwhile film with great direction and a great script with superb acting.","740":"Raw, visceral, and intense. The Hurt Locker at times feels like a documentary, and it pulls you in from the very first minute and doesn't let you look away till the end. Jeremy Renner gives a career defining performance while Bigelow shoots the action with extreme clarity. This is, overall, an engaging and moving piece of film.","741":"Astonishing! and truly triumphant filmmaking. Kathryn Bigelow's Iraq war indie film is truly a masterpiece and very different then your normal motion picture. From her style she chose to direct it gives us a very documentary, live experience sort of style making you feel like your right in on all of the action. Jeremy Renner gives a mesmerizing and truly Oscar worthy performance as William James, the Staff Sgt. who leads his crew through various war zones in Iraq while disarming dangerous bombs. Renner truly became consumed by his character from his recklessness and adrenaline seeking attitude in the war, along with his vengeance and fury upon learning of the death of a young boy. Renner is no doubt one of the stars to watch as he is going to have one great career ahead of him. The supporting cast was also excellent with Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce.The war sequences itself were very realistic looking from the shootouts, sniper scenes and any scene where combat is suspected to occur. It gives the audience a sense of paranoia as to what may happen. It brings you to the edge of your seat. Truly exciting. It also gets very emotional when members of the team become injured and\/or die because the way the film is constructed you feel as if you are right there with them. I also loved the scene where Renner's character goes out for blood due to the death of a young boy, this espionage scene was awesome, dark and ironically a great foreshadow to Renner's future role as a spy in The Bourne Legacy. The Hurt Locker gets you hooked from start to finish there is not one dull moment and it has an awesome but at the same time somewhat emotional ending as you know how reckless the character is and that he may have returned to face his own death. The Hurt Locker is truly worthy of the Oscar it won and is no doubt one of the best films of the decade. The best war movie since Platoon, and the best modern war movie.","742":"amazing movie. awesome direction","743":"It was crap, boring unrealistic dross.","744":"This movie was ok but not Oscar worthy. I have no idea how it won best picture against Avatar. I guess it won because we were at war.","745":"The only time I wanted to walk out of the cinema was watching this film I've watched it again on Netflix and it still is completely crap","746":"Fantastic movie! Great acting and overall phenomenal! Super suspenseful!","747":"A pretty good movie and deserving of the awards it has gotten. Great story and great performances!~ Average Movie Guy","748":"Astonishing. The Hurt Locker is one of the finest films ever made about \"modern warfare\" and its effects on those who must wage it. Imagine Jarhead, Generation Kill, and Black Hawk Down. Take what made each of those works brilliant, distill it and mash it together. You've got The Hurt Locker.MASTERFUL in its creation of tension, brilliant in its depiction of soldiers, superior in it's re-creation of an urban combat zone and shot with grit and assurance by Barry Ackroyd. Odd that the finest film yet made about our most current war and most current \"male subject matter\" has been made by a woman. Maybe because a woman understands that CHARACTER drives everything. TAKE THAT, MICHEAL BAY-SPLOSION!Cinematography, Editing, Direction--all Oscar-worthy, as is Renner's performance. if this isn't the first sure-thing Best Picture nom of the year, I may very well assassinate some members of the Academy.","749":"Awesome war movie. Defiantly the best war movie of the the 2000's. This film is intense and captures what it would be like in the Iraq war.","750":"A well acted and accurate depiction of the Iraq War, The Hurt Locker is a landmark achievement for Kathryn Bigelow, the first woman to win Best Director, but I'm not sure it deserved Best Picture. Compared to other war-themed Best Picture winners (Gone With the Wind, Casablanca, Bridge on the River Kwai) it leaves the viewer wanting. It was probably the beneficiary of a weak field rather than a stellar movie in its own right. That being said, when future generations look back at the Iraq War, they will undoubtedly look to The Hurt Locker, and rightly so.","751":"Pretty good. A little weird.","752":"Dont know why this movie bombed on the box office. Probably in my top 3 best war movie I watched.","753":"Simplemente no creo que mereciera el Oscar, una pelicula aburrida que fue alabada por la critica.","754":"A well acted, fascinating war epic. Kathryn Bigelow brings the Iraqi war to the big screen with such realism, that you think it is a documentary.","755":"One of the best movies I have ever watched. Jeremy Renner was great.","756":"well made movie, good story, but forgot some elements of the real-life bomb squad","757":"The best film ever made about the Iraq war. A Masterpiece!!!","758":"Good. But questionable. 2009's best picture, though? Not deserving in my opinion.","759":"White knuckle tension, this wonderfully shot combat masterpeice is my second favorite war movie ever made, only slightly behind the great\"apocalypse now\" Kathryn Bigelow earned every Oscar this film recevied. She keeps it at such a tense and low key rate that you will forget you're watching a dramatized movie. An A+ modern warfare film that sets the bar for any other predecessors that may try to follow in its glorious footsteps.A+","760":"Looks like a fake war report","761":"??Guy Pearce????5??????...","762":"Very watchable real life style and not bogged down in political messages","763":"Prettty good war film. But, instead of having huge battles, its more of a slow paced thriller.","764":"every movie about iraq is popular cause it makes people feel like theyre concerned by watching it but this film has no story-it's just a sequence of events. there is no goal\/obstacle or character development, which is screenwriting 101. i call it a FAIL.","765":"This is easily Jeremy Renner's best roles to date. Now i just need to let my fingernails grow back.","766":"A different war movie plot","767":"Jeremy Renner and Kathryn Bigelow. Welcome to the big time. This movie puts the audience in a very uncomfortable seat, but we are compelled by the story and action. It is movies like this that keep us going back, just like Renner's character. Bravo!","768":"Aww! So good! Far beyond the vast majority of War dramas of recent times, very impressive","769":"Instant war movie classic set in the modern Iraq theater. Very suspenseful. Sitting on the edge of your seat sounds clich\u00e8, but absolutly fits.","770":"\"There's enough bang in there to blow us all to Jesus. If I'm gonna die, I want to die comfortable.\"For some reason this movie hit it big with the critics, but never seemed to gain much momentum with ordinary people. It's a shame because it's a good one. Love Jeremy Renner in this, and not just because he's family. lol","771":"This was an interesting but not great war movie. Its whole theme of a soldier needing the war has been done before and in better ways. However, it's still a good movie. I especially liked Anthony Mackie's standout performance. Don't think this is deserving of Best Picture but whatever; it's just me.","772":"Perfect. slow at times, but there is a surprise at so many parts, so that evens out. such a great movie","773":"I liked this film for it's realism.","774":"By combining a fraught, anxiety riddled atmosphere with some unexpected events, Katherine Bigelow has created a truly gripping war movie worthy of its critical acclaim.","775":"Might be a bit dramatic, but it's unique characters and interesting plot makes Hurt Locker stand out.","776":"The Hurt Locker is brilliant cinema in its truest form, a war drama that brings us an unforgettable performance from Jeremy Renner and a flawless directing job from Kathryn Bigelow. A masterful piece of filmmaking.","777":"A movie that ranks up with war greats like Apocalypse Now and Saving Private. Ryan with no shame at all, with excellent screenplay, direction and cast.","778":"\/10Acting - 9.5Writing - 9Dialogue - 9.5Plot & Characterization - 9Cinematography & Editing - 9.5Soundtrack\/Score & Set Design - 9.5How much I enjoyed it personally - 9","779":"A thrilling, yet human, approach to the War genre. Also, I'm incredibly happy this film beat Avatar for Best Picture.","780":"Es curioso que una pelicula llena de testosterona haya sido dirigida por una mujer, gran actuaci\u00c3\u00b2n de Jeremy Renner.","781":"The Hurt Locker is an example of a film that gets pretty much everything right, and like that review that is quoted on the poster says, it is a near-perfect film. I really like the story; it builds up the tension slowly and develops in a very realistic way. Some have said that the film doesn't really have any story but I don't agree with that. It starts off with a powerful quote and then places us right in the heat of the mission and just carries on from there and I liked that approach. I thought the film would be different given the cover that has all the bombs on it. I thought that part would be the main plot point of the film with someone that made a mistake by finding them and was now stuck over all those bombs for the duration, or something, because it has been awhile since I put this on my list, so much so that the cover on RT has changed twice, and while that scene certainly had me in awe, I was happy with what it was. The film was shocking and unpredictable, much like a real war. Most of the time it felt like a horror film, especially when everyone was watching what the main characters were doing, the sense of dread that fills every scene never lets up and I was fully engaged in the story, so much so that every time a plane flew over the characters I thought a bomb was going to drop. The film has an excellent script that pays attention to its characters and they are all written excellently, there are many scenes where characters are allowed to breath and it is great to see these characters talk and interact. The cinematography was absolutely gorgeous and really enriches the experience further; the film has done an excellent job when I feel bad sitting here drinking water because the characters are almost passing out from dehydration. What was done with the budget that they had is outstanding. I'm also surprised that those little bots that they used lasted as long as they did; I thought they'd be shot down really easily. There is a scene where someone gets told to a few times to movie his car and then gets told to stop it and that just made me think about the guy in the car and how he must have felt. The cast is outstanding and everyone does an excellent job with a brilliant lead performance from Jeremy Renner. At first he seems very quiet but before long his true side is revealed and he comes across as being oddly relaxed throughout the entire mission, we learn why but it is certainly strange to see at first and our reaction is similar to the characters at that moment. He was nominated for an Oscar for this film and it was totally deserved, he totally looks the part and gave such a complex performance, he would also be nominated for an Oscar the following year, too. There was also some surprises with some actors that show up during the film and they were great to see but I still wish Guy Pearce was in it more; it's funny how the biggest names have the least screen time. Everyone else does an excellent job and I can't picture anyone else in the lead roles, especially in Renner's. Colin Farrell, Willem Dafoe and Charlize Theron were originally considered for lead roles but considering Bigelow wanted relatively unknown actors for the roles, it makes sense why they weren't chosen and Bigelow and Dafoe have worked together before too. There is a character that Jeremy Renner's character meets early into the film and those two have some scenes together and there is a part where something big seems to have happened with that storyline and that felt like such a huge coincidence at first and seemed like such a poor choice for a film like this but before long it carried on and actually went a different direction and it surprised me and I am glad what happened did. The final shot of this film is something very noteworthy to talk about. The final scene of the film is already very powerful but that final shot is perfect, the song that is playing and the way the text fades in at the end and how long they focus on it is just something I really loved and it just made my jaw drop. It was raising the score of the film the longer it went on but you can't go any higher than five stars, which is what I was already going to give it. I've seen films cover this type of theme before but here it really connected with me and it was done in such a powerful way. I will never forget this film and that ending solidified it. Speaking of the soundtrack, the soundtrack for this film is very angry and it makes sense considering who made it and what trilogy it came from. I won't say what the theme is as it might ruin some of the subtly but it fits the film very well, especially in that final scene and that song in particular also foreshadows Bigelow's next film, and it also introduced me to some awesome music.It only happened less than handful of times but slow mo is used in some scenes, and while it looked visually interesting, it felt kind of cheap to be placed in a film like this, especially when it was being used at the start. I understand why it was used but it gives the impression that it was going to be one of 'those' war films and while I personally didn't hold that against it, some might. There was also a scene with the other people on the team not really being happy with their leader and while it resolves itself, pretty much, in that one scene, I would have liked the character it is related to, to have found out at some point, it isn't a problem with the film, it is just something I find annoying in anything. I also thought some scenes ended too early, it doesn't happen very often but the scenes that do end early I think could have just gone on a little more. After taking a few years off, Kathryn Bigelow comes storming back with an excellent film, I certainly wouldn't have guessed it would win Best Picture, considering how one of the producers nearly ruined its chances, but it definitely deserves it, as well as everything else it was nominated for. That producer was talking negatively about, 'Avatar', and James Cameron was the one that convinced Bigelow to do this film, it's funny how everything works out. It is also Anthony Mackie's second time he was in a film that won Best Picture. Early in the history of the Academy it used to be Oscar 101 to make a war film but this fantastic film transcends that and I bet Bigelow is happy she changed her mind and decided to direct this film, because, like Barbara Streisand said, 'well, the time has come' and I'm really happy for her. I haven't seen K-19 as of this review but it certainly looks like this film doesn't take liberties with the facts, so not only is this a realistic take on war but is also a very powerful character study. The lowest grossing Best Picture winner of all time but that could change very soon... Tense, smart and brilliantly acted, The Hurt Locker is an excellent film from director Kathryn Bigelow and another film off the list.","782":"It is much better than your average Middle East war flick with astounding cinematography, and well-acted, complex (if somewhat unlikable) characters. Though it isn't something I would watch again.","783":"Deffo a must watch loved it","784":"There are merely two things I harbor a mortal and an undying hatred for in this universe. Injustice and this retarded movie. The most overrated piece of shite I\u00b4ve ever seen, seriously. I\u00b4m sorry, if someone claims authenticity for their picture yet fails to even get the uniforms or ranks right? ACUs in 2004 Iraq? Come on Bigelow! An E-6 (Staff Sergeant) wearing E-7 (Sergeant First Class) insignia? Seriously? An EOD drilling a moving target , 1 mile away, in the head with a 50. Cal? I dont think so. Leaving the F.O.B. without permission in the middle of the night , being caught by guards and they simply let you go? No way in hell! That\u00b4s technically going AWOL, you would be on your way to a nice prison cell in Ft. Leavenworth instantly. And that Iraqi cab driver running into a checkpoint at that speed would have been riddled with NATO rounds, you couldn\u00b4t even tell his body from a sieve afterwards. I genuinely hate this movie, the worst Best Picture in over 80 years, hands down.","785":"A US army bomb disposal tec makes waves in his new unit because of his Gung Ho attitude. The Hurt Locker is an interesting war film, mainly because its indie sensibilities make it a very unusual treatment of this subject for a product of the US movie making industry. It's quite a reserved, unsentimental film about the impact of a \"war\" that has no visible enemy; not quite in the same way as Jarhead in which the soldiers just could not find an army to face, but because the enemy hides itself in plain sight amongst the innocent population. This obviously causes great conflict within the soldiers, always unsure whether to fire or not to fire and seemingly never able to punish the perpetrators of the atrocities they witness on a daily basis. It thankfully avoids heavy-handed patriotic bullshit instead concentrating on the effects of the situation on each individual and the fine performances all round make for an interesting character study. The \"battle\" sequences are also very well staged and it is technically very accomplished on every level. The only faux pas for me was the closing scene in which \"our hero\" is striding purposefully back down a Baghdad road to a heavy metal riff which was a bit too John Wayne and seemed to be at odds with the tone of the whole of the rest of the film, but otherwise another quality war film about a very sensitive subject.","786":"Intense. Suspenseful. Gripping. Heart-thumping. And hugely satisfying. The Hurt Locker, out of all the films on Iraq War, is the best so far. Very well directed by Kathryn Bigelow, well shot in its raw cinematography & tightly edited, its biggest surprise is the suspense it creates & the surprises it keeps throwing at us throughout the runtime. And the performances are brilliant as well, esp. by Jeremy Renner. The Hurt Locker is a war drama without any climax but still, one of the best films of its year. Why? Because you'll know when you're in it.","787":"Reminiscent of Jarhead, but not lacking the Hollywood pace. This film was told with suspense and allegory as its main strong points. Renner was flawless in this role.","788":"Masterpiece someone called it. I agree! Intense and mind gripping and. Filled with suspense and fantastic acting by Jeremy Renner!","789":"The Hurt Locker masterfully weaves between stunningly authentic and heart stoppingly tense situations that are bolstered to near perfection by Bigelows assured direction and powerful performances from Renner and Mackie.","790":"Renner, Mackie, and Geraghty are all excellent, and Bigelow creates a masterpiece.","791":"One of the best Iraq war movies. A worthwhile film with very good acting performances as the characters struggle with war.","792":"Heard it was a very good movie.","793":"Although it may be one of the best attempts at transferring the Iraq War into film, the Hurt Locker doesn't stand out much from other great war epics and to be honest, it lapses into boredom to often. It isn't a terrible movie, but it's not a great movie either.","794":"A couple fine slow motion sequences, but other than that, what the heck justified 6 oscars, other than cinematography? Long to sit through.","795":"Esta no es la ganadora del Oscar.","796":"Non solo un film di guerra perfetto sotto tutti gli aspetti tecnici, ma anche un profondo ritratto psicologico dei suoi protagonisti. Sono proprio i pensieri dei soldati i veri protagonisti del film, spinti al limite da una condizione di estrema angoscia e ansia. Tutto questo viene trasmesso allo spettatore con intensit\u00e0 e realismo, grazie ad un ottima regia sorretta da un montaggio preciso e un comparto sonoro eccellente. La regista riesce a conferire al film un tocco terreno e pragmatico, con le coraggiose riprese a mano e tagli di montaggio repentini e frequenti. Meritatissimi tutti i prestigiosi riconoscimenti che ha ricevuto, si tratta di un ottimo film di guerra che non deve essere dimenticato.","797":"A great, pulse-pounding war movie and one of the most intense dramatizations I've come across about the Iraq War.","798":"Great movie about War in Iraq","799":"BEST WAR MOVIE After Depalma's Casualties Of War.","800":"Good, but not great in my opinion. I couldn't understand how this won Best Picture.","801":"The suspense...The suspense...","802":"Amazing performance from Jeremy Renner","803":"The Hurt Locker is not your typical war film. It has your usual war torn environments and shots of soldiers trying to stay alive, but the difference with this film is that it focuses on a bomb disposal unit. This is something which is not commonly shown in films and is nice to get a focus on it. It also helps in a big way that the film was shot in Jordan. Being so close to Iraq gives you a genuine feel of watching a documentary rather than a movie. The trademark slow motion shots that Bigelow includes are also a nice welcome.The Hurt Locker also excels at the casting. Whilst now a familiar face, the movie benefited from having the unknown Jeremy Renner as the lead. It gave you the chance to connect with the character and appreciate his actions. It is also nice to see Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes pop up in small roles.As the first modern war film, The Hurt Locker succeeds as what it sets out to do and deserves the praise it gained.","804":"This movie is great. The acting is flawless and the story is flawless.","805":"Would be 5-star if it wasn't for the goofy third-act solo revenge mission.","806":"Good wasnt really good its not realistic its more for entertainment but it was good movie !!","807":"Sad, bad; made me mad that I spent time watching this half-baked war flick. What's the problem? No real plot, nothing too interesting going on, hyper-realism that's both essentially boring and at the same time all too real...so it's more like a documentary highlighted by typical \"illuminating\" contrived back stories. The entire movie felt very phony in its pretensions. That said, it wasn't preachy, at least not directly, and the acting was credible. I give lots of credit to the director for getting this movie made, but it's not much of a movie either. How could it have been improved?- by adding a political framework for the Iraqi point of view...are we just supposed to assume the usual contagion\/animosity and all its stereotypical components? What about the sectarian strife between Muslim factions, etc? Is this merely a bomb squad movie that happens to be set some place in the Middle East?","808":"Surely an exceptional and brilliant film on the Iraq War, and it certainly captures the entire audience. The movie's very tense and gripping, but it still remains one of my least favorite \"Best Picture Winner\" movies as it didn't impress me as much as others did. I still liked the movie; the ending was very emotional and made me sad. :(","809":"Kathryn Bigelow is a genious and I don't say this because I like her work- I think she's terrible- but beacuse she knows what it takes to be successful.1) Marry an acclaimed and overrated director,2) Learn all the sectets about being successful and rich,3) Break up with this popular icon and accomplish fame with your break-up,4) Hire a talented scriptwriter to write for you about the American army in the recent Iraq war.5) Beat your ex by winning 2 Oscars because you showed how good America is and what a good American you are.6) Direct another movie about- what else- the American army about the killing of Osama Bin Laden and hope to win another Oscar.You should be ashamed. This is not art. This is taking advantage of ethnists and making what they want to see into a movie just to win fame,money and Oscars.","810":"A relentlessly terrifying experience that's more than the sum of the shots fired or the bombs disarmed, director Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is a picture that's true to the horrors of war - particularly the psychological anguish incurred even in place of physical harm - and not the run-and-gun action normally associated with lesser-in-meaning war movies. With a strong cast; exceptional directing and cinematography; and a moving, often gut-wrenching thematic overtone that analyzes the fragility of the human condition through the prism of the uncertainty of war, The Hurt Locker sets a new standard for genre excellence and has solidified itself as a contemporary war movie classic.","811":"I always thought Jeremy Renner was amazing and in this he is SPECTACULAR! This film has everything you could want plus an amazing script! Everything feels authentic kinda like you're watching a Hollywood Documentary but the people are all coincidentally amazing actors! I could watch this movie over and over!","812":"The Hurt Locker was an exceptional movie and should end up in my favourite movies of 2010. It's intense, without question, but the film is action packed and with a number of superb performances throughout the movie, it keeps you on the edge of your seat - especially considering the subject matter at hand. Jeremy Renner is sensational here also.","813":"Meilleur au deuxi\u00e8me visionnement.","814":"Bigelow is a master at building suspense and tension, and she succeeds with this film in flying colors, as she paints the screen with ticking bombs and assassins. The screenplay is solid, and the cast is outstanding. Highly recommended.","815":"Izuzetan! Nabijen adrenalinom!","816":"Really good moments, slightly ruined by some really boring moments. It is a bit overrated, but it's definitely a good movie.","817":"Best look at Iraq post 2003.","818":"amazing movie! very realistic and intense!","819":"One of the most suspenseful films in decades, perhaps the best war movie of the 21th century yet with great performances, great directing,cinematography and sound.","820":"I fell asleep during this movie... Twice. American bravado no thanks.","821":"An intense and riveting look into U.S. army bomb disposal team, which is furthered by excellent acting and great cinematography.","822":"Didn't hit me quite as hard as I expected it to, for some reason, but it was really well-shot and well-acted.","823":"This is one of those films that has been on my must-see list for years. I heard a lot about it when it was sweeping up a bunch of Oscars, and it intrigued me then. My interest only increased as I became more familiar with the stars of the movie in other performances. So I was very excited to find this airing (unedited) on TV. Wow, what a powerful film. There are few movies I have seen where the realities of war felt so genuine. The way that Kathryn Bigelow chose to capture some of the scenes gave the film almost a documentary feel at times. You felt like you were really there with actual soldiers. Of course a great deal of credit for the genuine feel of the scenes also must go to the cast of actors. I connected with them, and completely bought into the idea that they were soldiers in a real war. They bickered, and also came together because of the tough situations they were facing as a team. Life-and-death isn't a strong enough term to describe the stakes they face in some of these scenes.The writing by Mark Boal is exceptional. He framed the movie nicely, opening with a scene that sets you up to understand what these guys do and how risky their job can be, then closing with a scene showing how this job can completely change them. This is easily the best performance I've ever seen from Jeremy Renner, but Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty were also brilliant. They did a nice job of showing 3 different sides of how soldiers might deal with the harsh realities of war. I almost want to say this movie was one of the best I've seen this year, but I think what kept this movie from being an all-time favorite is that they didn't quite have enough character development scenes. At times it felt like this was jumping from one set piece to the next and we were not given enough time to establish how much time had passed or whether these guys were growing closer or still at odds with one another. My least favorite scene of the film was the cliched \"let's split up\" scene that ended Eldridge's part in the story in a completely unsatisfying way. Yet the bomb disposal scenes were so intense, and felt so raw and real that I would gladly watch this movie again any time. The end even made me question what life must be like for real soldiers considering all that they see and experience. This is an excellent film, one that deserved a lot of awards.","824":"an absolute standout, showing casing not what the physical damage behind war is but the mentality. Kathryn Bigelow definitely earned her directing oscar for this film. it certainly showed what she is capable of and Jeremy Renner is absolutely brilliant. Words can't really describe how well this movie was made just go watch it and you'll see what I mean.","825":"Boring and unrealistic.","826":"Rewatched this. Still as intensely captivating as the first time.","827":"Rating: 98%The Hurt Locker has Jeremy Renner in his best role in his entire career, along with a suspense-filled screenplay and a handful of great supporting actors.","828":"Not impressed at all by this. I think I was excited that Avatar lost, but this was just not a good movie. Up should have won. The characters, especially Jeremy Renner, are so unlikeable and they have Ralph Fiennes but then only give him like 5 minutes on screen. It relies a lot on Jeremy and he is just so stupid and unlikeable. He would never be a leader in the real life EOD crew.","829":"Overhyped and already done.... but still, I watched it all.... unless you have an affinity for war movies or have never seen a Vietnam war movie you might be ok to skip this.","830":"This movie is really powerful. I feel a tension behind everything throughout the movie that gets me invested and concerned for the characters. Interestingly both times I watched this movie were on flights to\/from China.","831":"What I remember of it was being enthralled. 8-9\/10?","832":"thought it was ok little borring in parts","833":"Simply put, it's one of the most thrillingly alive films ever made. The suspense holds a cloud over the events; every moment of the film feels dangerous. Everyone is in danger, and no one can be trusted. In the all too real world of \"The Hurt Locker\", there's distrust and even tested bonds of brotherhood, as well as the limits of basic human forgiveness and understanding.This isn't a war movie, persay. It's a movie about people in war; human beings tested to their absolute limit, and once they reach that limit, they're nothing shy of addicted and terrified in equal portion.","834":"Real, human depiction of what will go down in history as the worst idea ever.(The Iraq war). Having watched it 4 times it is one of those movies that I will click on whenever it comes up on the dial.","835":"Intense modern war movie about the Iraq War. It seems smaller and newer than what were used to (Saving Private Ryan) but no less interesting and investing. Kind of a character study, as well as a war drama. The acting was great and the cinematography and effects were great of course. Seems shorter than it was, in a good way. The end cereal scene was very simple but fantastic. Great end.","836":"I saw Zero Dark Thirty before The Hurt Locker, and I would have to choose the latter as my favorite. Where Zero Dark Thirty was definitely an adequate epic of sorts, the stagnant story - forgettable almost in its entirety - was a shockingly large letdown. The Hurt Locker is shorter, sweeter, and commands a much superior direction. Interestingly, almost all of the photography is stunningly kinetic - flaming with an undeniably awe-inspiring energy, captivating the viewer, carving intense images into the conscious. The shots are gorgeous. Slow-motion technique is used sparingly, to great success, and eye-popping HD shots of half-second events extend the phenomena to powerfully vivid proportions. Also worth realizing is Renner's terrific performance as James, the blithely flippant IED defuser. Thought-provoking and fiercely tensioned, The Hurt Locker is an instant success and the best dramatization of the Iraq War to date.","837":"People do not believe what happens to people in the Iraq War but in The Hurt Locker there are more serious and action with great script by Mark Boal and Kathryn Bigelow wants to be better than James Cameron but represents great way for all this movie. It is the second film with more words \"F\" to win the Academy for best picture, as is The Departed. The best movie of 2009 and the second of all life.","838":"Simple thrilling movie not too excessive not to boring. All were done nicely.","839":"Excellently written characters, relentless directing, amazing acting, and a compelling story to keep you hooked from start to finish. The Hurt Locker is relentless in showing the gritty\/dirty side of war that's been done before but yet feels fresh. I recommend this to action-film-fanatics and film buffs alike.","840":"I love Kathryn, but this film in my eyes just doesnt deserve the hype.","841":"This is nowhere near suspenseful, this is no good acting nor good directing or anything at all! Nowhere near to a thriller, just pure boringness.","842":"Gripping and tense throughout, perhaps a little too much without offering any intervals. The Hurt Locker really dwells on fascinating character development. and ask the important question of what war may do to someone more than just physically or psychologically, but in some ways spiritually. William James crosses this line and falls in love with his job that could kill him anytime, but it is also the very joy that he seeks. Each character, or in a broader sense, each soldier has their own \"hurt locker\" hidden somewhere, you can either keep trying to hide it, or you could open it and really let it kill you.","843":"You gotta watch it ...","844":"hand-held through and through, guess I'm not a fan","845":"I bought this movie on Blu Ray without ever seeing it. Given all the hype about how brilliant a movie it was, I've gotta say I was pretty disappointed when I watched it. Don't get me wrong, it's an okay movie but it was no where near as good as the hype. There were illogicalities in the plot, and some tenuous scene transitions. The action scenes were hit and miss. Compared to productions like Band of Brothers and The Pacific, The Hurt Locker certainly left me feeling a bit \"Meh\".","846":"This movie describes the danger of doing the job in Iraq. Entertaining and thrilling. The best scene was the shoot out in the desert and defusing 6 detonates as a scene.","847":"Love it SO MUCH! Action-packed everything!","848":"It may be painstakingly tedious and ostensibly excruciating; but The Hurt Locker doesn't really offer you the realistic ambiance it promises, despite its precise direction and superb performances.","849":"There are no words to describe how powerful, impactful, and hard-hitting this film is.","850":"Beautiful direction, thrilling action and great acting!","851":"Addiction to something you love, wow, quite an interesting thing to start with.","852":"In terms of violence and gore, \"Saving Private Ryan\" has the upper hand, but \"The Hurt Locker\" is still up there, focusing more on the characters instead of the gore, and when the gore does come, it's grotesque and realistic, but the fleshed out characters, beautiful direction, and in depth storyline made me care about the film more. It definately deserved Best Picture.","853":"A man has to do what he got to do","854":"I've watched it multiple times and still feel it's intensity and emotion everytime.","855":"It was a very intense and heavy story about the realities of war on one's mental state. It portrayed well the monotony of everyday missions without the \"get the bad guy\" goal most war movies have.","856":"Intense! beautifully shot","857":"I'd like to point out that Bigelow with her impressive techniques knew well ezay teshedd el CRITICS ll film da! =D..the movie is impressive as a technique..make up..cinematography..and especially the directing..I won't be so depressed if Bigelow took the Directing Oscar even!..bas as a whole it didn't deliver that much!..the first part didn't satisfy me!..the second delivered lots of feelings,meanings,esqataat seyaseyya wad7a(kal3ada),wel '5alta' el mo3tada American racism and how filthy that war was and how CARELESS an American soldier could get!..msh ba7eb aqaren moqarnat sazga..bas..my bottom line isss..'Hiiii's to the Oscars..Avatar BEATS it ;)!..","858":"A good example of why we should have gotten behind the war effort, and not against it.","859":"I love the suspense of this film upon first viewing. I don't think the movie would have quite the same powerful effect upon second viewing.","860":"We get another movie where the \"flawed war hero\" almost single handedly saves the day. We do not get to feel conflicted about the U.S presence in Iraq but get presented with insurgents and extremists that serve to justify it. \"The Hurt Locker\" fails to be what an exceptional war movie should be: unbiased and able to show both sides of the conflict.","861":"\" one of the best war movies ever made\" & \" the most exciting action film in years\" & \" the most stunning and nerve- shredding film you'll see this year","862":"Explores the psychology of the tragedies of war in an unsentimental way. Brilliant.","863":"Great mOvie!! SO sad tO see what Our bOys Overseas have tO deal with!!","864":"Slow paced film but ok","865":"BEST WAR MOVIE OF THE 2000S, BY FAR! It's like a mix of the explosions from Transformers, the slo-mo scenes from The Matrix, the acting from Fight Club, the suspense of Jaws, the dark comedy from No Country for Old Men and the awesomeness of The Dark Knight.","866":"Great script.. Although repeated theme and somewhat over-ratted movie","867":"Kathryn Bigelow delivers one of the best war flicks to date in this intense, gritty, Iraqi War centered story. Emotionally exhausting and believably real, this story touches on those parts of the military that don't get a lot of attention when it comes to hollywood epics. Not your traditional war drama, something way better. Jeremy Renner is gold.","868":"First off, as many have rightly said, this is NOT an Iraqi war film. This is a film about the \"rush\" of war, and the flirtation with danger, and that fragile catalyst which can send you over the edge and into an early grave.Never, in my opinion, has this subject been covered so concisely, with such passion or detail. This is simply as study of the men and women, but in this case men, who not only put their lives in danger for others, but for themselves.The performances were first rate across the board, with an inspired choice and use of cameos, such as Ralph Fiennes, who was pitch perfect, as well as the ever likable and reliable Guy Pearce, and an amusing turn by David Morse.But all these were far from through away, in fact each demonstrated a different aspect of the war junkie, with Fiennes British soldier, being one of the best. War is tough and each solider must face their own horrors of it in there own ways, but this offered a take on the horror as something that some men are bred for, but not in a monstrous way.The genius of this film is in its lead, Jeremy Renner, who is portrayed as a headcase of sorts, constantly seeking and reveling in moral danger whilst being very intelligent, skilled, disciplined, whilst given at times going too far, and most importantly, with a strong moral sense; a true soldier.This is a respectful and yet revealing war film, that deserves the kudos which it has received, and is up there with the best. The reason that I only scored it 9\/10 is due to its only real flaw and that is in its pacing.It does take its time, and for the most part that is not bad thing but there are moments in which it does move a little too slowly and the narrative is quite episodic in nature, and slightly fails in fully engrossing you all of the time.This was the nature of the beast and even though I loved this film, it failed on that point for me. Otherwise, brilliant, 10\/10 critically and a MUST SEE!","869":"\"The Hurt Locker\" is an outstanding and honest depiction of the war in Iraq with thrilling action scenes that shows the experiences of the bomb squad in the military and Kathryn Bigelow's best work, thus far.","870":"I have never really enjoyed war films. I am by no means a pacifist, but to me all the stories seem to be the same, and until now, I've been uninterested. It wasn't until viewing the Academy's best picture of 2010, The Hurt Locker, that I started to see things differently. In these films, it's not so much the story line that matters, but rather the characters that are featured in the film. The description of The Hurt Locker is just as bland as any other war picture, the story of a unit in Iraq that is responsible for disarming explosives. What makes this film so unique and made it the best film of 2010 was William James, played remarkably well by Jeremy Renner. Renner is known as an action star, so when I saw him nominated for best actor, I couldn't believe it. The truth is Renner's performance in this film was outstanding, because for once, he simply played himself. Renner may have been portraying a Sargent in Iraq, but the personality was his own. Director, Kathryn Bigelow, has become known for letting actors be themselves in developing their characters personalities, to the point where even some of the dialogue was in the spur of the moment. The Hurt Locker is a powerful film, with remarkable events and heartbreaking moments, but it's the films personality that is larger than life. I enjoyed every second of this film and it was truly the best choice the Academy could have made for best picture.","871":"it's just an awesome movie","872":"Best true to life war film since Oliver Stones Platoon(1986 Charlie Sheen, William Dafoe, Tom Berringer, Forest Whitaker, Kevin Dillon, Johnny Depp i could go on if you want, ). Even though it's a fictional story based upon actual events in Irac. both films capture the innocence of the every day American solder confronting the horrors of war. Jeremy Renner is one bad ass soldier, he could've been cast as a good sgt. Barnes, there characters are both equally confident in there combat experience also completely nuts. FIVE STARS Jeremy keep up the good work.  Micmic Boston,Ma","873":"Hard to watch at first, but Renner is so good in this it makes you want to know more and completely forget that he is not Sargent William James but Jeremy Renner","874":"an intense movie with good acting.","875":"Seemingly offering some food for thoughts for the Iraq war, but American Imperialism deep inside for the world depicted will worsen without the presence of the fearless and devoted American soldiers. The arrogance and slow peace prevents me from enjoying the film.","876":"It was excellent till the very end which really disappointed me.I found it hard to believe that Renner's character had one thing that he loved and that that was war. Because if so, it was like saying to his son that he doesnt really love him or his mother. I find hard to accept and extremely unrealistic the fact that he is a war junkie that has a family but doesn't give a shit about it.","877":"Excellent movie, but I have no idea how this beat out Avatar for the Oscar though; this style of movie has been done before and better in Jar Heads, Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, and Generation Kill.","878":"Extremely realistic, touching and with fantastic actors, screenplay, cuttings and sound. In every way a great movie!","879":"Great depiction of war.","880":"Too silly for my words.","881":"This was one of the best intense movies that I have everseen.","882":"This war movie is like none I ever see before, it maybe the greatest war[film]. But some inaccuracies got in the way. Though Renner's performance was amazingly great.","883":"Sublime direction and storytelling. Compelling acting. But too damn long.","884":"Had to shake the rocks out of my boots....","885":"Not suspenseful or action-packed in any way. I personally was disappointed with 'The Hurt Locker'. But great acting and terrific cinematography help pick up the slack.","886":"Damn, this movie is so good, the first time I saw this I totally hated it! I thought it was absurd, and idiot! But now the second time I found it cool, slow and boring at times, well written, not well directed, and good performances. The direction is, for me, one of the worst things of the movie because it's dizzy. The first time I reviewed this movie I put it a 40% rotten and now 80%, I like it more now.","887":"\"The Hurt Locker\" is a well made war movie. I do however believe that it is killed by the hype. The performances are all great, especially Renner. Though the quietness added an element of realism to the film, it also made it lack stronger suspense. Thats not saying that there are lots of suspenseful moments in the film, which are all spot on. Overall this is one of those films that receives crazy critical acclaim and is just good rather than actually perfect.","888":"A masterpiece, well shot, well executed, the slow motion make it even more interesting","889":"An action story laced with journalistic pedigree. What a picture! -- A","890":"Jeremy Renner shines as a super ballsy specialist. Another great war movie","891":"one of the most engrossing war movies i've seen. outstanding movie. Jeremy Renner is the real deal.","892":"One of my favorite films of all time....","893":"Jeremy Renner's character was a Sgt 1st class not a Staff Sgt, and Guy Pierce's character was the Staff Sgt not a Sgt. Oooh you civilians do some fact checking on stuff like would you please?","894":"\"You love playing with that. You love playing with all your stuffed animals. You love your Mommy, your Daddy. You love your pajamas. You love everything, don't ya? Yea. But you know what, buddy? As you get older... some of the things you love might not seem so special anymore. Like your Jack-in-a-Box. Maybe you'll realize it's just a piece of tin and a stuffed animal. And the older you get, the fewer things you really love. And by the time you get to my age, maybe it's only one or two things. With me, I think it's one.\"","895":"It's a good war drama that's well-acted, but The Hurt Locker's final message to the world ultimately escapes me; is it pro-war or anti-war?","896":"Thoroughly and visually disappointing, I can't tell the difference between this movie and any other war movie based in the modern era. Renner is great in his role, but the surrounding cast and following scenarios can't live up the the task.","897":"My first thoughts were, \"Oh, no. It's going to be Top Gun with bombs.\" This, however, turned out to be a moving film about the life of soldiers who go overseas, put their lives at risk (in this case, diffusing bombs) and see\/experience terrible things. It gives audiences a look into what becomes of these soldiers - physically, emotionally, psychologically. It's handled so convincingly and with a solid performance from Renner.","898":"The Hurt Locker is definitely a realistic and brutal look at a war that should've ended a long time ago, but it has little heart for a war movie and a less than satisfactory ending.","899":"meh could have cut this up into 3 short clips and still worked, thin plot with a continuous main character......sure it is greatly shot but that's about ithype from being a sensible war movie with emotions i guess","900":"It's nice that R.Fiennes, Morse and Pearce had cameos, and that the bulk of the acting was by actors i've not seen before. Its comparison to avatar is inevitable and i think it justly won the award. Purely on a personal note i'd rather see actors\/esses than animation providing the actings not shit which it wasnt. Mackie and Geraghty are affable in portraying their situation while Renner hits the nail on the head with his cowboy come war addict performance. Not as tense as i was expecting and for me that's the only fault","901":"The Hurt Locker de Kathryn Bigelow es un film que muestra otra faceta de la guerra, el trabajo abrumador de los equipos anti-bombas adem\u00e1s de la repercusi\u00f3n que la guerra puede causar en la vida normal de un individuo, en algunos casos llev\u00e1ndolo al extremo de ya no poder tener una vida normal. Uno de los films b\u00e9licos m\u00e1s relevantes que debe haber. Bien actuado, inteligente, sorpresivo y lleno de tensi\u00f3n desde el inicio, simplemente no puedes apartarte de la cinta.","902":"That Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director were well earned. Brilliant performances from Renner, Mackie, and Geraghty.","903":"Fairly intense movie","904":"This movie is one of the few that genuinely works as a big exciting action movie and a profound war drama. I know people throw that description around a lot, but here it seems appropriate. By no means is The Hurt Locker boring- it's probably one of the most interesting, edge-of-your seat films ever made. But it also take great strides toward artistry- the motivations behind the characters take on an unusual philosophical sophistication, and watching it you begin to understand how these characters are responding to the conflict. It's not particularly political- it prefers to focus on the notion of war itself rather than the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In doing so, it prepares to stand the test of time, and that's what renders it great. The Hurt Locker is not Saving Private Ryan, nor is it Apocalypse now. The Hurt Locker paves its own road, and in doing so turns out quite grand.","905":"i waited over an hour in the theater for this movie but it was well worth it. a must see for all...","906":"Totally overrated. I was bored stiff with this movie -- maybe the boredom could kill you. Not sure how so many critics liked this movie. Man disarms bombs, goes back for more, the end. Avoid if you haven't seen it.","907":"It was so real, deep, heavy and great Iraq war movie. Jeremy Renner was really great. Female director Kathryn Bigelow created men's movie so strong and great. Climax was shocking and speechless. But I wanted to see Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, David Morce and Evangeline Lilly more... Blu-ray's HD picture was great and sharp, dts surround sound was dynamic and so deep!","908":"Una cinta sorprendente, puesto carece de la mas minima estructura y contenido donde basicamente un fulano que empieza siendo un yonki de la guerra va encadenando escenas que no avanzan en historia o desarrollo alguno para acabar descubriendo lo que ya sabia, que es un yonki de la guerra; aun asi, resulta una obra imprescindible de nuestro tiempo, y en si misma, unica e irrepetible.","909":"Jeremy Renner shows how good of an actor he is in possibly the most realistic film ever made about the War in Iraq.","910":"With a ginormous amount of meaning attached to it, this is perfect the way it is .It takes us beyond our balanced, normal world and gives a full pledged peek into some real insurgence and bold counteraction. And with it being a war journal, one can't halt the emotions that the unpredictable nature of mortality death brings. Renner is at his acting best. First-person-shooter games have now earned an extra point from me. I an simply in love with this.","911":"Bored with movies about the war that never portray it correctly, they don't even come close!!","912":"Brilliant edge of the seat action and gripping story line.","913":"So, what was the point? War is a drug? Where is the War? Jeremy Renner is a great actor, but his character in this movie makes no sense. Actually, none of the movie makes much sense. The first 10 minutes is awesome. But thats about the only Oscar-worthy minutes in a rather dull, pointless movie.","914":"I really love this movie. Renner does a great job displaying the psychosis of a bomb squad agent. Very powerful.","915":"This proves that action is not the only way to gain audience. You need a great story enriched with a great script.","916":"In the top 5 war movies of the decade.","917":"The suspense nearly killed me.","918":"One word: suspense. An excellent, gritty war film chronicling a lesser discussed field of military occupations. Pacing is excellent and the sense of dread, panic, and anxiety is constant. A truly great war film that should go down with the greats.","919":"The Hurt Locker is freakin' great.This movie isn't by any means new to me. I own the DVD and have watched the movie several times. The only reason this review is coming out now is because I'm a lazy bastard. Anyways, this movie is one of my personal favourites. It follows a trio of soldiers who are tasked with disposing explosive devices in the midst of the Iraq War, and it is one hell of a nail biting ride. This isn't so much a war movie as it is a suspense thriller, and man is this thing overflowing with suspense. Moreover, this is a very interesting type of addiction story. The whole premise of the film is that a man is addicted to the adrenaline rush of being on the very edge of death. In a way, war is a drug, and our main character's addiction to it puts him at odds with his fellow troops. It's a very unique study of the human mind in times of war, and one that has never been explored. Everyone gives fantastic performances, the special effects are just awesome, and the sound design and score are phenomenal.The Hurt Locker is a beyond intense, nail biting movie that will have you on the edge of your seat for the entire run time. Watch it on a good TV with the audio cranked way up. Trust me.","920":"This is a really good film. It sure proves that woman can direct as well. Jeremy Renner did amazing.","921":"I don't normally watch war films but i'd heard a lot of good things about this one so I gave it a go. I wasn't disappointed.","922":"There is no prizes for guessing why this movie won an oscar as it tells its target (American) audience exactly what it wants to hear. Namely that the experience of the U.S. military in post-invasion Iraq was one of basically decent indiviuals trying, with varying degrees of success, to bring safety and security to a burnt out wreck of a land inhabited by the helpless preyed upon by the cruel and inhuman hiding within their own ranks. What it does not dwell upon is why this land is so burnt out in the first place and why an effective intifida is underway, with the U.S. and not the Isreali army on the receiving end. The bomb scenes are excellently done but asides such as the intrepid bomb team having to step in and save a British special ops team in a desert is just ludicrous. All-in-all a terrific effort but badly myopic on the causes of the conflict and the scale of destruction meted out by the invading Forces.","923":"I've read a lot of reviews that used the term \"raw\" to describe this and I can see why. It's not a film that has a typical intro, climax, and denouement. While there are certainly atrocities depicted, I saw this as a more thinking man's war movie as is seemed to explore the more psychological aspects of modern war. There is no pat resolution. It is not a pretty movie with a clean and tidy ending, but war never is.","924":"This is not just another Iraq movie, this is the best dramatization of the Middle Eastern conflicts and is filled with nail biting suspense thanks to solid, believable performances and superb direction.","925":"I just didn't get that much out of this. Performances are strong, though, and some of the direction is very tense.","926":"This movie is overrated.","927":"The war becomes a drug for many, and they will keep coming to it because life without it is just...boring. The struggle and life of someone whose life became intervene with combat.","928":"almost every aspect of the movie gets a 10 for me but i dont think it warrants the best picture nod it got. while it has really intense sequences and good acting, the hurt locker fails miserably at having any semblance of character development or even a simple story arc.","929":"A wonderful depiction of it's thesis: War is a drug. Not only is Jeremy Renner's performance top of the line, but a strong supporting cast drives the movie as well. Excellent camera work and editing. A must see film for this decade.","930":"Fantastic Movie very suspenseful, with amazing acting.","931":"Everything in this movie was well done and worthy of all their movie nominations... It's just that this movie was also ridiculously depressing. I mean, the sound editing\/mixing, the acting, the story, the script, the character arcs, the story arcs... Everything was really well done. It's just that war movies are so fucking depressing. People die in it, and there is rarely a happy ending. I do admire how the movie gave a human side to the Iraq War, but ajkldhfjha gosh, this movie was just frustratingly depressing. So sorry. This would be a five-star review, but I'm not a movie critic (thank goodness), so personally, it's just too depressing for me to give it five stars.","932":"Impeccably intense and engaging!","933":"Awesome movie that is very well told. Plot is unbelievably intriguing and acting was surprisingly amazing. Border line 5 stars.","934":"A well acted and intense movie. This is one of the best war epic and it was directed by a woman, Kathryn Bigelow. Who said a woman can't make a epic war movie..But one think i'm not giving this movie 5 star is the fact that it's a guy flick, it was't for all gender to enjoy. It would be nice if there's some mellow scene after all the killing and shooting.","935":"I'm trying to watch all of the Oscar Nominees.","936":"Overrated!! Not too bad though..","937":"the last explosion scene was soo sad","938":"It maybe a little bit disturbing, but it's suspensfully good, and it ties to \"Avatar\" on being 2009's Best Picture. (A)(Full review coming soon - with better wording probably and requires another viewing probably)","939":"A good film! Nicely filmed and great photography. Not so sure if it is worthy of an Oscar, though.","940":"A film with good narrative and a good performances, especially Jeremy Renner's. Kathryn Bigelow's directing is amazing and the film had a correct screenplay. A realistic picture with a dark tone and an amazing cinematography.","941":"About the men, not the war. About the feelings, not the fights.","942":"Really intense, brilliant Iraq War set action thriller led by stars Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie who absolutely kill it in this film as this shows a truer than ever before experience of Iraq and a look into the scary life of a Bomb Squad! Great Film!!","943":"WTF!? THE HURT LOCKER WASNT EVEN THAT GOOD!Have def seen alot better war movies!","944":"\u00f0?Even though this movie goes a little over the top, the grips and nerve-aching sequences, along with the vividly humane performances from the cast creates this astonishing drama that satisfies in most senses. A favorite.","945":"A war movie taking place in Iraq and there have been many movies based from that place so far. This movie follows a bomb squad and it takes place mostly on the field so there are many good action scenes. Great acting and well made exciting war flick and i prefer this kind of genre like this flick.","946":"Loved the first and last 30mins. Guess I had high expectations as this film was \"the bomb\" at the awards. It just made me wanna watch Iron Man ;)","947":"The Hurt Locker is a movie that begins the same way it ends, but my saying that isn't going to give anything away. It's true that it's not a typical, Hollywood-camera-caramel flick; it doesn't adhere to any formula but the one that was discovered for its sake when it was filmed. It is certainly an independent film in this regard, and, if watched intently, is a powerful experience.","948":"The Hurt Locker is an intense, unflinching look at the bravery of our soldiers, the gruesome hardships they face and the toll it begins to take on them. I enjoyed many parts of this movie, but my favorite is when Renner's character realizes he hates living at home because it's miserably boring and returns to the bomb squad because he loves the rush it gives him.","949":"Good as an action movie but the lack of realism (50 cal rifle and CQB), especially having been there myself kind of ruined it for me. The insight into what EOD does and the tension was used well though.","950":"This is quite possibly the best war movie I've seen since \"Full Metal Jacket,\" though it seems to be less about war than any other. There are no grand battle scenes and no swelled up music score to manipulate emotion. The suspense starts with the very first scene and never lets up. Kathryn Bigalow, one of the most underrated action film directors ever, uses mostly hand-held cameras, thus putting the viewer right in the middle of the action.  Jeremy Renner is amazing in the lead role of Staff Sgt. William James. With this one film, he has gone from frequent character actor (\"What movie have I seen him in?\") to a potential Best Actor Oscar nominee. His love for war is scary. He thrives on the thrill; it's his natural high. He seems more at ease when diffusing roadside bombs in Iraq than choosing a cereal while at the supermarket in civilian life.  One of the more intense scenes involves a desert shootout. There is no fast moving action; no loud music score or quick editing. We are there with the soldiers, as they take cover from terrorist snipers a few miles away across the open desert. The standoff lasts for hours as both sides wait patiently for the best shot. James and his team battle the insurgents as well as heat, fatigue, thirst, and flies.  This is truly a great film, destined to become a classic. It deserves a wide audience. Hopefully it doesn't get lost in the multiplexes among the Harry Potters and Transformers.","951":"Immensely overrated on every level -- especially writing & acting. for the life of me I cannot figure out why it got so much buzz...other than politics.","952":"Really intense movie. Very well acted. Basically just you're glued to the movie the entire time. Just really intense!","953":"Eventually got around to watching this. Great film. A real eye opener!","954":"Nauseating camerawork. Too bad, since it sounded like a good movie otherwise.","955":"The Hurt Locker is a dirty and very intense movie with outstanding performances especially by Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie. I can see why it was awarded with OSCARs...as this film sticks with you for a while - whether you want it or not.","956":"Didn't deserve best picture The Dark Knight deserves best picture like this movie was good but definitely not Oscar worthy like the only reason it made it to the oscars was because the academy was like we should pick this movie as nominee to dedicate our troops that soooo dumb","957":"11\/30\/2012: a pretty good military flick. Not good enough or enough action to watch multiple times.","958":"da story of EOD...  i watched dis wid breathless attention...","959":"An immersive and painfully relevant story. After winning 6 Oscars, it probably doesn't need my review anyway.","960":"A Shock And Awe movie","961":"Story of racism and getting along.","962":"The Hurt Locker is a movie you wont easily forget. A great script and an outstanding acting leads to an Oscar winning film. Never let up, very fast past quick shots. The cinematography and directing in this film works because of the great people behind the cameras. Kudos Kathryn.","963":"War just sucks. Not just for the innocents, but also for the soldiers who have to see and live through it.","964":"Was a good film, owever i felt that it was a tad too long, and slow in places","965":"I'll give it a 3 because of the random appearances, and the guy who blew up the first day on the field.","966":"great- fantastic- better plot, better shot, better actors, better suspense, better everything than Zero Dark Thirty. Overall, great and one of the best movies ever.","967":"one of the best war films I have seen, it's unconventional and one of those films that lingers with you after the credits have rolled.","968":"Really fucking awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1","969":"Iraq - What a god forsaken country and war that was.","970":"Very slow moving and drawn out. However, a fairly intriguing and interesting portrayal of the war in Iraq.","971":"Jeremy Renner nails it as the lead in this interesting\/on the edge of your seat war film. Kathryn Bigelow definitely has the chops to pull off a small budget action film. Recommended!","972":"The Hurt Locker tells its story by breaking it up into different episodes. Each one is titled by telling us how many days are left in this groups tour in Iraq. This is a war film about the adventures of three men during the Iraq war. It doesn't have much in the way of an overarching story, except that its characters remain (mostly) consistent throughout. While some come and go, our three men generally are always present.  We begin with the death of man tasked with defusing a bomb. It's a long scene that ends when his squadmates fail to shoot a civilian with a cell phone which ends up being the trigger. This man's replacement ends up being Sergeant James (Jeremy Renner), an overconfident young man with a wife and child back home. His group consists of Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Eldrick (Brian Geraghty). Most of the time we spend with them involves one mission or another, with downtime being skipped. They have forty days left until they can return home.  Any suspense generated is typically done in one of two forms. Either the group will be dealing with a bomb that could go off due to an error or because any random civilian could detonate it, or because snipers could be everywhere, and the group constantly has to be on guard for that. Road mines are also common, and the group's Humvee could be blown to smithereens at any moment. A quote opens the film, and it tells us that war is a drug. In many ways, I can see that's true. The Hurt Locker certainly presents itself to make sure that point gets across to the audience.  The episodic format that the narrative is told through actually works for something like this. When we just get done with one tense scene, going back to base and waiting a few days before the next one could harm the pacing. By simply skipping those parts and fast-forwarding to the next thrilling part of the solders' lives, we are always involved. There are enough character moments thrown in, but this is mostly an action-thriller. It certainly does a good job at filling both genres' expectations.  As the group goes on more missions together, tensions begin to rise. At one point, Sanborn and Eldrich contemplate killing James, making it look like an accident. It makes sense why they'd want him gone -- he is, after all, a danger to their group thanks to being an overconfident man who works with bombs for a living -- but James never finds out that they thought about it, which is surprising. There's a scene in which all three characters get drunk together, which seemed like the perfect moment to increase the tension by having it slip from one of their mouths. No such luck, I'm afraid.  The tension of the group doesn't actually last all that long, and it's eventually forgotten that they even fought. Only through a very stupid decision does it get brought up again, and even then, it's only for that one scene before it's deemed \"water under the bridge.\" I get that the film wants the characters to come together and become friends, but doing it as early on as it happens here doesn't help the already-disjointed narrative. It gives us one less thing to think about, and despite director Katherine Bigalow's attempts, the characters (especially in the case of Sanborn and Eldrich) fade into the background.  Sergeant James is really the only character that gets enough development to make him relatable. He's an adrenaline junkie, someone else says, and that's a pretty apt description from where I'm sitting. But he's also funny, a risk-taker, and generally a likable guy. He even becomes friends with one of the Iraqi children who tries to sell him bootleg DVDs. But once he starts working on the bombs, he becomes focused and we get to see a real craftsman at the top of his game. It's enjoyable to watch him wherever he goes, and it makes sense for the film to focus on him.  Jeremy Renner's performance is what really makes the Sergeant's character work. It's a very subdued job, although he's pretty much the perfect actor for this type of role. He can be cocky, he can be confident, and he's athletic enough to perform in the actions. But he's also kind of an everyman. Mackie and Geraghtly are relegated to supporting detail, but despite that, they're strong and make what little character they're given work. Other supporting roles -- in these cases, the characters usually appear once and then aren't seen again -- go to Guy Pearce, David Morse, Christian Camargo, Ralph Fiennes, and Evangeline Lilly.  If nothing else, The Hurt Locker feels very authentic. I don't know if it actually is -- I have a hard time believing some of the things these soldiers get away with could actually happen -- but the way it looks and feels makes you feel like you've just experienced war. It's a very gritty filming style, primarily consisting of handheld shots, but it works well in this case. The action scenes are all very intense, and you feel that, at any point, the lives of these people could be at an end.  The Hurt Locker is a very exciting movie about the Iraq war. It contains a solid lead performance from Jeremy Renner, has nerve-racking action scenes, and works well telling this one man's story, even if that means the supporting cast is ultimately inconsequential. It feels real, it looks real, and it's a fine journey to experience. I was never bored while watching it, and while it has a few flaws, they're easy to look past both while watching and afterward. Definitely give this film a watch.","973":"Great war movie. Suspense is executed excellently, specially because the viewer is submerged into a very realistic-looking (no idea how it compares to the real thing) combat. When the bombs are not ticking, there's a sniper ready to kill off any of the protagonists. The movie succeeds in making you want it to finish as soon as possible, thus reducing the casualties. Still, not convinced with the character development, specially since they had two hours for just three soldiers. There's the super-hero, the young candidate for PTSD and the black guy, who can be all he can be, except as good as the white guy.","974":"Excellent film - enjoyed it! Little slow in places however.","975":"Mostly gritty and gripping, but too often devolves into war-movie schmalz.","976":"While many criticize its accuracy, the tension that the film builds is absolutely outstanding and the acting is spot-on. Its heart is in the right place, too.","977":"War is a drug - quote from the movieSuit up","978":"ok but a bit slow in parts and too long","979":"You want to see a movie that is designed to convince America's white trash how cool it is to be a cowboy-soldier? Welcome to war propaganda in The Hurt Locker. A \"masterpiece\" that will show future generations what went wrong at the beginning of the 21st century. Watch the movie and you will have an urgent need to wash yourself to get rid of the dirt that was put in front of you, War propaganda that could have been produced in Goebbel's ministry of silly walks.","980":"I may not enjoy this movie like many others but during the 2 hours long movie watching, it really does not disappoint and certainly makes you on edge of seat most of the time.","981":"Almost perfect Iraq movie","982":"Great military film with deep undertones","983":"As a portrayal of OIF, aka the 'War in Iraq\", this is complete fiction. No loose cannon soldier would be tolerated by his peers or his command, he is simply too dangerous, too unreliable, and too much of a risk to be tolerated. Anyone who knows EOD personnel (I'm not EOD) knows they are adrenaline junkies, but they are not reckless, haphazard, or foolish. Additionally, the \"episodes\" especially the sniper scene, are laughable. This is fantasy garbage, if you are a civilian and want and insight into life of EOD, watch Bomb Patrol: Afghanistan. If you want to get a good sense of military service, try Citizen Soldier. As for \"intensely shot\", really? Which scenes are well shot - interesting angles that evokes the narrative or feeling, editing or pacing that adds to the film - sorry can't recall any, even after being forced to see this 20 times by hoo-ha friends! This sucks.Posted March 19, 2017 CIB and Star, V devices on B Star and ARCOM, Masterblaster, long and short tabs.","984":"Kathryn Bigelow's movie is a portrait of the Iraq War. The acting is incredible as the plot. The storyline does not have many twists but at all times the movie causes tension in the viewer. War is a drug and we see that she does not leave the scene in no time. Despite being repetitive at a certain moment the film is engaging.","985":"This is a well made and suspenseful movie. I'm not convinced about the hype surrounding it though. Still it should definately make your viewing list","986":"This isn't on the same level as Black Hawk Down is but the Hurt Locker is still another thrilling, well-acted, and fairly original movie about the Iraq War which is definitely worth a watch.This movie follows 3 soldiers in the Iraq War. They are trained to disarm bombs and they face the threat of death every day as anyone could try to kill them as seen in the beginning of the movie.In most war films, armies face each other directly and battle. In this movie though, the enemy hides in plain sight and the soldiers have no way of knowing who can be trying to kill them. Often when they disarm bombs, several possibly dangerous people watch them and any one of them could try to kill them as is shown in the intro. This of course creates conflict between the troops and this movie explains some of the conflict that arises between them.The scenes where they disarm bombs are very tense because the viewer knows that the bombs could go off at any second. This is made clear from the memorable opening scene. The movie also brings in factors which helps to raise tension even more. It shows several possibly dangerous onlookers, a man driving a taxi within the bomb site, and a man holding a remote which may possibly set off the bombs. The shootout scene near the middle isn't that impressive compared to other scenes in the movie In terms of originality and suspense but it doesn't take up too much time to begin with.The acting is pretty good. Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty were the main actors and they carried the movie well. They don't have too much of a variety in terms of their facial expressions and emotions but they still do their best in the movie and they show that they are talented actors.A common problem found in many war films is the lack of character development. Like many other movies of the genre, this movie also suffers from that problem. The movie doesn't give us something big which makes us care for any of the characters. This is a common problem which arises in many war films nowadays and I hope that it will be fixed sometime in the future.Despite the lack of character development, this is still a great war film which contains some pretty memorable and original scenes which hold a lot of tension often. It is definitely worth a watch and it is one of the better war films in recent memory.","987":"This wasn't a really good best picture winner, but there are a few moments here which makes this flick salvageable.","988":"This is a truly great film, very fascinating","989":"A near perfect film. The Hurt Locker gave us an insight in the war of Baghdad and how a war can also be a drug. It's thrilling.","990":"Kathryn Bigelow brings a unique vision to the modern day war epic. This film has unique and stunning cinematography and outstanding performances that really makes this film a standout in its genre. The way its written and filmed feels like a documentary with each segment really making you feel like you're there. In regards to Mark Boal's screenplay I must say I appreciate how he tells stories we don't typically see in this genre such as; the diffusing of bombs in both its relieving success and tragic failures, the long time and focus it takes to be a sniper and mercenaries privately contracted to capture\/kill terrorists themselves. I could go on about the cast but it's really Jeremy Renner's show playing a soldier thats so desensitived by war that he feels more comfortable in that environment then safe back home. Overall, worth the watch as one of the few war films that truly makes you feel like you're there.","991":"Well acted and the most intense piece of cinema I have ever had the pleasure to see, its easy to see how it beat Avatar to Best Picture and gave Bigelow Best Director. It is hard to watch at times, but feels very honest and particularly bias free, fantastic movie.","992":"Trash, utter trash. A movie can tolerate being inaccurate or riddled with poor acting, directing, and writing, not both. I can only assume Bigelow screwed her way to the Oscar.","993":"I was blown away by this movie :P","994":"One of, if not the best war movie I've seen","995":"After seeing this movie win the Best Picture Academy Award, I needed to see this movie. I thought it was very interesting to watch about an elite group of US Army soldiers: Jeremy Renner (S.W.A.T.), Anthony Mackie (Notorious) and Brian Geraghty (Jarhead) who, and while on their tour of duty in Iraq, have one of the most dangerous jobs: Disarming bombs in the heat of combat. Kathryn Bigelow directed a very intense and visually stunning movie that earned her the Academy Award for Best director and being the first female director in history to win it. I liked how the sound was used in the explosion scenes and how it also won the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing. The performances of Renner as the courageous Sgt. 1st Class William James and Mackie as the by the book Sgt. J.T. Sanborn I thought were both excellent. They somehow remind of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon. I thought Geraghty\u00e2??s performance as the young tough Owen Eldridge was good and I loved how Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential), David Morse (The Rock), Evangeline Lilly (TV\u00e2??s Lost), and Ralph Fiennes (Schindler\u00e2??s List) made special appearances in this movie. Both Intense and visually stunning, THE HURT LOCKER is a very entertaining movie that I\u00e2??m glad picked up the Best Picture Oscar instead of Avatar. Sorry, James Cameron.","996":"I thought this film would be worth watching, because I like intense war films. After watching it, I was surprised to find that it far succeeded my expectations. Almost every part in this film is so breathtaking, I couldn't tell what was going to happen next with so many twists and turns in the film (no, I'm not going to spoil it so don't ask). It can be a very emotional piece of work. Everything about this movie was brilliant!","997":"i just watched this movie again and it was perfect these days the war movie modo is big budget and no point the hurt locker breaks that glass ceiling with a brillant script,emotion,acting and plot the hurt locker will go down as one of the great war movies.","998":"Possibly the most boring, uninteresting, and pointless script ever written. Yes, the film is meant to portray the daily lives of these bomb disarmers, and I don't have a problem with the excrutiatingly slow pace, but the film becomes less a feature film than a horribly mundane docudrama with better acting.","999":"just watched this movie again and it was perfect these days the war movie modo is big budget and no point the hurt locker breaks that glass ceiling with a brillant script,emotion,acting and plot the hurt locker will go down as one of the great war movies.","1000":"Greatly involved story. Filmography supports this and helps build a story that can only be called immense.","1001":"Brilliant, brilliant film from start to finish!","1002":"Muy buen trabajo se\u00f1ora Bigelow.","1003":"It was probably a great movie, but very slow and hard for us to watch. We had to bail about half way though.","1004":"This movie is an excellent thriller.","1005":"The best movie of 2009","1006":"Very entertaining story. Worth owning and seeing more than once.","1007":"Intense look into the lives of an American ordinance disposal unit during the Iraq War. While I thought the various sequences were interesting, there was a complete lack of story tying everything together. It almost seemed like random documentary footage spliced together minus the voiceover. So, while gripping and entertaining, The Hurt Locker never really seems to get any point across to the audience.","1008":"if you've heard anything about this movie you've probably heard its amazing. i also heard the hype and went into the movie expecting a masterpiece and im not sure if it reaches that status. it wasnt really anything i expected besides the obvious and thats probably a good thing because for a war movie it still holds a feeling of origonality. i definatly would not call it one of the best war movies ever though. i'd put it on the same page as behind enemy lines or platoon but nowhere near the calibur of saving private ryan or full metal jacket. people also call apocalypse now one of the best but i have yet to see it. even though hurt locker apears to be directly about the suspense of the bomb squad but in the end we're revealed a pretty deep character study. I guess what im trying to say is that i wasn't exactly blown away(no pun intended....honestly)by the hurt locker, probably due to the hype, but in the end i was far from disapointed. hurt locker is a good movie in that it shows us how our troops keep dying when we so often hear about it on the radio or see it in the news. now that we know how all we need to find out is why.....anyone? why?","1009":"O.V.R 8....can't believe I've waited this long to see it!","1010":"Explosive, dominating, an emotional firestorm, The Hurt Locker is just simply Brilliant. It's a packed adrenaline rush, filled with such crafty dialog by Mark Boal, and amazingly directed by Kathryn Bigelow, Jeremy Renner, I have to say gave the most soulful performance of the year,with such firey intensity that will have you be shocked and awe. This film is just brilliantly casted, written, directed and photographed. This film gives you the reason to love war films. It's like Platoon but on a much bigger and better scale.I put this as one of the best war films with Saving Private Ryan, Patton, The Thin Red Line, Letters from Iwo Jima, and Flags of Our Fathers. My pick this year for Best Actor at the Academy Awards is on Jeremy Renner.","1011":"The Hurt Locker is easily the best \"dramatization\" of the Iraq War. It is excellently acted, notably Jeremy Renner, and well paced. The action sequences are very intense and entertaining. The bomb disarming sequences will have you on the edge of your seats. Considered to be the best film of that year, The Hurt Locker is a war epic unlike any other."},"Username":{"0":"Matt D","1":"Marks V","2":"Jared D","3":"Brett C","4":"Christian H","5":"Chris-Meat C","6":"Cenon M","7":"Simon S","8":"Bastian A","9":"Steve V","10":"Jimmy M","11":"Raya P","12":"Henry F","13":"Greg T","14":"Rory R","15":"Austin L","16":"Arash B","17":"Brian K","18":"Stephen B","19":"Gerald D","20":"Amy P","21":"Jase H","22":"Matthew M","23":"Connor Q","24":"Meredith W","25":"Chris C","26":"Zach M","27":"Edgar C","28":"Zack J","29":"Brandon H","30":"Tosaka T","31":"Johanna E","32":"Eerik S","33":"Jacob L","34":"Private U","35":"Leo L","36":"Scott W","37":"Steve G","38":"Javier F","39":"Alex K","40":"Angelo S","41":"Mike B","42":"char s","43":"Langston T","44":"pedro t","45":"Thiago A","46":"Abdulaziz A","47":"RJ R","48":"Nate J","49":"Shae S","50":"Darren C","51":"Jess L","52":"Aakash G","53":"Joel P","54":"Mateusz N","55":"Luis G","56":"Elliot T","57":"Rae K","58":"Evan T","59":"Dick T","60":"Matthew B","61":"Adam R","62":"Archer F","63":"Jason E","64":"i C","65":"Ryan W","66":"Dave C","67":"Alejandro M","68":"Rahul B","69":"charles b","70":"Christian B","71":"Garrett V","72":"J M","73":"Felipe P","74":"Jorge Eduardo S","75":"John G","76":"Harry W","77":"Jacob S","78":"Rakesh M","79":"Travis T","80":"Diana L","81":"Adam S","82":"David F","83":"Jason D","84":"Simon P","85":"Craig H","86":"J.
