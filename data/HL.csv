347,14-Jan-14,954573411,"Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is something I felt was different in a war film. Rather than focusing the film in the reasons why the country goes into war but rather the reason why a soldier wants to be in the war. It details on the experience of these soldiers in their placement in Iraq. This is also the film that made Kathryn Bigelow and Oscar contending director and has proven herself again in her next war film, Zero Dark Thirty.The plot of the film is a bomb squad that consists of William James (Renner), J.T. Sanborn (Mackie) and Owen Eldridge (Geraghty) doing their service until their rotation is over. The screenplay by Mark Boal captures the deep experiences of these soldiers very realistically. It doesn't try to take notice of the audience using large action and chaotic sequences but rather explore these soldiers' feelings towards their duty and the psychological trauma they endured. I enjoyed the storyline with Eldgridge trying to understand death and trying to shake the fact that one moment you are here and the next you aren't. But the main focus is on James as his reason is that he loves his job and that he would risk his own life, even though he has a ""family"" back home, to feel the adrenaline pumping. I love that it shows how is actions affect others, especially those close to him professionally and personally. Boal seems to understand the war at a more intimate level, which he did with this film, and he also can see war in a much more bigger picture like in his second film Zero Dark Thirty.Kathryn Bigelow is a filmmaker that I feel neutral to as she has entertaining films like this one and also has not-so-good ones like Blue Steel and The Loveless. I feel that her next few films after Zero Dark Thirty will really show whether or not she will be the next great director. This film is a fantastic drama of war and this is maybe because Bigelow is handling the film, and also has a great script. If this film was in the hands of more action oriented directors then this may been half an hour shorter and would spend less time on characters but instead on situations.The film doesn't move really fast in my opinion and so great editing in scenes is needed to keep the audience interested. Memorable and thrilling moments like the sniper battle do stretch for a bit with minimal action but with great editing keeps you in the edge of your seat as anything could happen.One of the stronger aspects of the film is the cinematography by Barry Ackroyd who did the other war film I enjoyed, Green Zone. This film, that Ackroyd also did for Green Zone, is very gritty by keeping the image very grainy. It's appropriate for the setting and the theme. There are moments that are captured uniquely and may be a little bit pretentious. I see it as ambitious and makes the film different from the war films in recent years. The use of shaky cam in order to create a sense chaos and anxiety may be a little too much but I have seen so many of these in films that it does not bother me so, but I do acknowledge that it is there and it isn't for everyone. The most beautiful moments that Ackroyd has captured is the slow motion events, whether it is the blowing up of a bomb or the fall of a bullet form a fired gun, it is breathtaking.Beltrami and Sanders' score is not dominating but it is eerie and dark which supports the experiences of these tortured soldiers. There are a lot of moments where it is complete silence in creating a sense of tension but when certain situations happen, their score starts to haunt the scene.The film has three convincing and breakout leads. They made these guys potential blockbuster acotrs, especially Renner. They fill in the shoes of these characters with such depth and vulnerability. I adore that these are not expendable characters that just have 2 or 3 emotions. The film includes appearances of great actors in small roles like Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce. Their roles may be small but it is strong and definitely something noteworthy. Their appearance feels like there is weight when something happens to them.This film is not trying to make a statement about war but the soldiers that go in and do the hard work. This film may in the future be regarded as a war classic due to its subjective approach and is well deserving of its accolades. If you want a visual spectacle in its approach to war then don't watch this but if a study of soldiers is what gets your interest then sure try this out.",Brett C,4.5

It's superb performances, especially by the lead Jeremy Renner (""The Avengers"") , director Kathryn Bigelow's fantastic artistic talent, and the pure audacity that this one rises too is unmatchable.

816,6-Oct-12,872758003,"An epic realistic war film about a bomb squad within the Iraq War. Every action scene is memorable due to its tense, isolated feeling, you get the true sense that war can be extremely blind and at some points your shooting at nothing just to defend yourself. Jeremy Renner puts in an award winning performance which really put him on the map as an action star, and really fits the part. He perfectly depicts a man addicted to the thrills of war, and once getting into it, he just can't get back to the simplistic lifestyle back at home, as much as he forces himself to think that he can. War becomes a part of a man's blood stream when they get too deep.",Rory R,5
817,4-Oct-12,906102546,"The Hurt Locker hits with the might of Spike Lee's Malcolm X, and the grit of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver.

716,6-Dec-12,917175836,"This movie is getting a lot of awards and buzz. I may have been going in with too high of expectations because although it was good I don't know that it was that good. The acting was good. It was an intense story and I can't even imagine how anyone can live like that under the constant threat of attack or being blown up, and that is when they are not even doing the bomb disposal thing. My problem is that the main character makes bad decisions that throws his team into life treatening situations. And instead of learning from his mistakes he keeps going back and making more bad decisions. The movie is good, but I just didn't like the main character enough to enjoy the journey.",Gerald D,3.5

713,7-Dec-12,820224076,"Why do I feel like I am the only person that realizes that this movie is complete drivel. Absurdly cliched characters put in completely unrealistic (but entirely predictable) situations with no semblance of character development outside of what you already know about the cookie cutter personalities from other stories. Admittedly, the first scene is fantastically shot, but it offers little outside of cinematography. From the moment you see the robot whizzing amongst the rubble you know things aren't going to end well for a character you're supposed to ""like"". Sadly, I know I'm supposed to like this character, but I just don't. Kathryn Bigelow makes it clear exactly how you are supposed to feel about the characters, but I had nothing but ambivalence throughout. Much of the problems with this movie I feel comes from an agenda on the part of the director. Too often I found the movie telling me what I should be thinking or feeling instead of making me think or feel it organically. In the end I did feel a bit of something: empathy for Jeremy Renner's character. Like him, I had become numb to the whole experience of the war which is being portrayed; a dull numbness to the struggles around me, not caring about anyone or anything [in the movie].",Matthew M,1

I was right at the scene where the main character is attempting to diffuse a car bomb, with limited success initially. At about the peak of the scenes intensity, my pager went off and my heart nearly stopped with fear. This is a prime example of the intensity of the film. This is what I THOUGHT ""The Kingdom"" would be. While there is no true ""plot"" per se, the fact that at times I forgot that the extras likely are also actors, and that we were watching a documentary on bomb disposal, should speak volumes of the reality of the film, and therefore it's quality. Best picture? Meh, who cares.

521,6-Apr-13,891495465,"In a realistic manner that Hits the viewer and captures their minds faster than most war films could dream of doing,The Hurt Locker makes excellent use of silence in it's storyline to project the intensity of the story without displaying breakthrough musical techniques to do so, and so the experience becomes simple and memorable for it, much like in Witness or Animal Kingdom. It becomes all the more realistic through the intense silence and the great cast in their excellent portrayal of realistic war dynamics, and so the buildup to the climax of this moment is one of the most powerful in war film history. So by the end of the intro, it's quickly cemented that The Hurt Locker is going to be a very powerful war film.For some viewers, the atmosphere may be worn down by the slow pacing, but the simple fact is that The Hurt Locker is one of the most character-driven war films to have existed in many years, and is one of the best to dramatise the war in Iraq.One interesting thing is the way that Jeremy Renner reminds us that his character is still human through mere use of costume change, in the sequence where he pulls a gun on a DVD salesman and returns to the mans house, and the entire sequence removes the audiences thought of him as a soldier and it becomes solidified that his character is merely a very strong human. However, in a stronger manner to lean to his characterisation is Jeremy Renner's fine performance.He levels humanity with determination and supplies a powerful breakout lead with just the character needed for The Hurt Locker. The entire cast is good, but Jeremy Renner carries them all very well and just provides excellent realism to it all.But the praise must be given to Katheryn Bigelow, not just for her decision to cast unknown actors and for handling the Iraq war so finely, but because of the inspiration from the fact that she is the first woman to win the Academy Award for best director and the fact that she proved how a woman may handle such a subject as well as anyone else which surely would disprove many chauvinistic thoughts of people worldwide. And it doesn't even change things because she's just a person who made a fine film, one so fine that it won the Academy Award for best picture. And the fact is, her knowledge of handling intensity and great action as we've learned from her action flick Point Break, it's obvious she's just the perfect director for a war film and delivers even more substance to the story than you could expect. Her handling of The Hurt Locker was just immaculate, and so she's the reason that it's all too memorable.So The Hurt Locker was a great simple look at characters experiencing the Iraq war, and it's one of the finest looks at it that the film industry can provide.",Harry W,4

1017,2-Jun-12,912399334,This movie is almost like a documentary of war and how it effects an individuals life to be out in the rough of it. It's a stark reality of what war is truly like. Although this movie is brutally realistic and brings you the viewer to the front line it allows us to hopefully learn a greater respect for those great warriors that risk all so that we can be a free nation. There are several war films out there but I feel that this one gives a more honest feel of what war is like in our day and age. It's far from pretty but it is a necessary reality as long as there are nations that hate free enterprise and a free way of life. I feel people everywhere should have the right to choose to live their lives as they see fit.If we as a nation learn to hate the freedoms we have enjoyed for the past 2-3 centuries we will have had so many good men and women die in vain. May our nation never stop loving free enterprise and stay a free nation under God.God bless the men and women who fight in the armed forces of the United States of America!

I'm tired of Hollywood portraying us as crazy cowboys for no reason. As a film this movie was very well acted and we framed.

447,15-Jul-13,909042422,"Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is something I felt was different in a war film. Rather than focusing the film in the reasons why the country goes into war but rather the reason why a soldier wants to be in the war. It details on the experience of these soldiers in their placement in Iraq. This is also the film that made Kathryn Bigelow and Oscar contending director and has proven herself again in her next war film, Zero Dark Thirty.The plot of the film is a bomb squad that consists of William James (Renner), J.T. Sanborn (Mackie) and Owen Eldridge (Geraghty) doing their service until their rotation is over. The screenplay by Mark Boal captures the deep experiences of these soldiers very realistically. It doesn't try to take notice of the audience using large action and chaotic sequences but rather explore these soldiers' feelings towards their duty and the psychological trauma they endured. I enjoyed the storyline with Eldgridge trying to understand death and trying to shake the fact that one moment you are here and the next you aren't. But the main focus is on James as his reason is that he loves his job and that he would risk his own life, even though he has a ""family"" back home, to feel the adrenaline pumping. I love that it shows how is actions affect others, especially those close to him professionally and personally. Boal seems to understand the war at a more intimate level, which he did with this film, and he also can see war in a much more bigger picture like in his second film Zero Dark Thirty.Kathryn Bigelow is a filmmaker that I feel neutral to as she has entertaining films like this one and also has not-so-good ones like Blue Steel and The Loveless. I feel that her next few films after Zero Dark Thirty will really show whether or not she will be the next great director. This film is a fantastic drama of war and this is maybe because Bigelow is handling the film, and also has a great script. If this film was in the hands of more action oriented directors then this may been half an hour shorter and would spend less time on characters but instead on situations.The film doesn't move really fast in my opinion and so great editing in scenes is needed to keep the audience interested. Memorable and thrilling moments like the sniper battle do stretch for a bit with minimal action but with great editing keeps you in the edge of your seat as anything could happen.One of the stronger aspects of the film is the cinematography by Barry Ackroyd who did the other war film I enjoyed, Green Zone. This film, that Ackroyd also did for Green Zone, is very gritty by keeping the image very grainy. It's appropriate for the setting and the theme. There are moments that are captured uniquely and may be a little bit pretentious. I see it as ambitious and makes the film different from the war films in recent years. The use of shaky cam in order to create a sense chaos and anxiety may be a little too much but I have seen so many of these in films that it does not bother me so, but I do acknowledge that it is there and it isn't for everyone. The most beautiful moments that Ackroyd has captured is the slow motion events, whether it is the blowing up of a bomb or the fall of a bullet form a fired gun, it is breathtaking.Beltrami and Sanders' score is not dominating but it is eerie and dark which supports the experiences of these tortured soldiers. There are a lot of moments where it is complete silence in creating a sense of tension but when certain situations happen, their score starts to haunt the scene.The film has three convincing and breakout leads. They made these guys potential blockbuster acotrs, especially Renner. They fill in the shoes of these characters with such depth and vulnerability. I adore that these are not expendable characters that just have 2 or 3 emotions. The film includes appearances of great actors in small roles like Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce. Their roles may be small but it is strong and definitely something noteworthy. Their appearance feels like there is weight when something happens to them.This film is not trying to make a statement about war but the soldiers that go in and do the hard work. This film may in the future be regarded as a war classic due to its subjective approach and is well deserving of its accolades. If you want a visual spectacle in its approach to war then don't watch this but if a study of soldiers is what gets your interest then sure try this out.",Brett C,4.5

Overwhelmingly TENSE that sometimes I forget to breathe from one terrifying scene to another more terrifying scene. The hurt locker is not a typical gun blasting combat movie but the mania of diffusing bombs under extreme circumstances in war torn Iraq(filmed in Jordan, country next to it) Th direction from Kathryn Bigelow was downright realistic and damn well near perfect. The Hurt Locker is structured around the 38 days the three men in the EOD (for Explosive Ordnance Disposal) squad have left in their rotation in Iraq. Men like Spc. Owen Eldridge (Geraghty) know all too well that every new day is potentially one they will not survive. They all want to avoid the hurt locker, the place where bad things happen. The 3 male leads especially Jeremy Renner, brought such unchallenged performances along with some special guest cameos by Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes.

100,1-Feb-16,910293797,"The Hurt Locker is a modern war film about the deployments of troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other countries that supposedly were Al Queda bases and the struggles that they faced. We mainly focus on three main soldiers who are waiting for the last day of deployment and getting sent home. Will they all make it through alive to the final day? Well, the film sure keeps that suspense throughout the runtime I'll say that much. Every scene where the soldiers are trying to accomplish a mission in a battlefield, it is extremely intense and horrifying. This movie is no pillow fight that's for sure. There's suicide bombers, violent shootings, TONS of explosives, and much more. It's utter hell and it doesn't shy away from showing how terrible these conditions are for the soldiers. The setting in Iraq looks beautiful cinematography wise, but is scary when you put the story aside it. The best part of the film, in my opinion, is the cast. Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty, and Ralph Fiennes were really good in this movie and brought forth memorable characters. Jeremy Renner in specific felt like a total war hero amongst them all. The scene where he carries a boy to safety after being stuffed with a bomb was a heartfelt scene that showed what this man is all about, and that is justice. I wouldn't call this a proud American film just because it's kinda gruesome and hard to swallow at some points and it's not trying to be patriotic either. It's just trying to get the point across that it's a terrifying place to be, but you are defending your country with your life. The story is kinda loosely tied in my opinion, there's no real storyline per-say but just one main focus, which is to survive the deployment and save lives of innocent people. It's a good story no doubt, but not an exceedingly strong one. The chemistry between the characters existed and I thought it was nice, but Mackie and Renner's relationship was the best in the film by far. Despite their disagreements with each other and opposing views, they knew they had to get along in the long run. The action, like I said before, is amazing. The opening scene to this movie sent shivers down my spine from intensity. It was really refreshing to see a film that can create more suspense than a good horror movie, mainly because it's a real life horror. There's no specific scene I'd take out of this film mainly because they all play an important part in the story telling process. That's when you know you've found an above average film. The Hurt Locker was a wonderful movie about a not so wonderful situation that Americans have to deal with on a daily basis. Kathryn Bigelow really outdid herself in this epic war tale.

Jeremy Renner gives an outstanding performance, and is able to convey a lot through subtle looks and movements. Additionally, there are some strong supporting performances by Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, and Evangeline Lilly. Bigelow's directing is also incredibly well-done and gives the film a gritty and raw quality.

333,17-Feb-14,913243906,"Originally, I thought that The Hurt Locker was a pretty generic and bland war movie. Upon a rewatch (this time at the behest of my friend, who has been butthurt over my dislike of it for six whole years), I still found it to be pretty bland,but nevertheless a much stronger film overall than I first thought. This movie definitely has the feel of a documentary, which is both its asset and its eventual downfall-- director Katherine Bigelow becomes so detached from the characters that she forgets to give them any emotional depth-- but the film is eventually salvaged by Jeremy Renner's career-making performance in the starring role and a story that is undeniably worth telling. It's not the Apocalypse Now of the Iraq War like some people are saying, but it's still not a bad movie.  The Hurt Locker stars Renner as a bomb defusal expert in Baghdad during the war in Iraq. During a couple of epic bomb defusal sequences, both of which showcase Renner's ability to be a friggin' badass without having to use a bow and arrow, he puts his squad in danger and takes unwarranted risks. However, Bigelow never goes too far, and always restricts his badassery to minor moments, like his cool and collected facial expressions while defusing a car bomb, or his ability to light up a cigarette after a near-death experience. The best part of his character is that, despite being a movie badass, he is still grounded in reality. No Live Free or Die Hard-style fighter jet sequences to be had here. However, the realism is undermined slightly by a scene in which one of the squad members (Anthony Mackie) suggests blowing Renner up in order to prevent the squad from being put in danger again. Okay, sure, we get that he's nervous about it. But forgive me if I don't see a military officer blowing up his commander. There's also a strangely surreal subplot in which Renner befriends a kid, finds his dead body, and then the kid comes back to life... or something... but fuck it. War is hell. We get it. Moving on.  The best part of The Hurt Locker is easily its story. Unlike other war films (cough cough Lone Survivor cough cough), it doesn't push a partisan agenda or force a message down the audience's throat. It just tells the story of what life is like day-to-day in occupied Baghdad. The first hour or so of the movie is actually quite great, showing individual days in extreme detail and sparing nothing. It starts out more like a serial adventure movie, actually, with a string of essentially unrelated bomb defusings, each more intense than the last. However, the problem with serials is that they have to end up having a unifying story throughout, and The Hurt Locker chooses an uninteresting subplot about Renner playing detective in downtown Baghdad as its way to hold the movie together. It's passable... but it could have been so, so much better.  The cinematography in this movie is (and I won't mince words here) shit. Sorry, but I've had enough of directors shaking their camera around at things and filming random stuff in slow-mo, pretending that it qualifies as an actual camera technique. Spoiler alert: It doesn't. The film does create some very good images (I know that the unwilling suicide bomber at the end of the movie will haunt me for some time), but at the end of the day, certain individual shots are more memorable than the movie as a whole. The slow-mo only really works once, when we see an IED go off at the very beginning of the film. After that, it just feels overused. And even when people are just talking, Bigelow shakes her camera around. Why? As the tension builds, she has nowhere to go. This not only holds back the nail-biting aspect of the movie, but the character development as well. Ugh, this movie could have been so much better.  Final Score for The Butthurt Locker: 6/10 stars. I definitely liked it a lot more this second time around, but it's still nowhere near the cinematic Christ that it's been purported to be. Like most other Best Picture winners, I feel that this film will be forgotten soon, and other great films of 2008 (In Bruges, anyone?) will take its place. Still, it was going up against Avatarded and the war crime known as Up for Best Picture, so I'm not sorry it won. But it tries way too hard to be a character study without actually giving the audience any development for the characters. Hey, guys in the military miss their wives! Never seen that one before. Still though, the film is worth a viewing, and is infinitely superior to Bigelow's follow-up, Zero Dark Shitty, which sucks dick. It's good... but it's not great.",Diego T,3

It's incredibly unrealistic, and I could get past that, but it goes beyond being unrealistic and at times appears downright disrespectful to people who have actually fought in Iraq.

91,28-Feb-16,901299487,"""Countdown in Bravo Company's rotation: 39 days"" 2004. In post-invasion Baghdad, the streets are a maze of unseen dangers. Every indistinguishable inhabitant could be an insurgent and every discarded object could be a lethal bomb.An elite trio known as the EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal) unit has one mission; to find and neutralize IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) safely and without injury. Working in these knifes-edge jobs are subordinate techs Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge's (Brian Geraghty). The rationally methodical Sanborn values procedure and protocols whist the skittishly high-strung newbie Eldridge's only assignment is to protect.However, when Eldridge fails to pull the trigger, Team Leader Staff Sergeant Matt Thompson (Guy Pearce) meets a vaporizing demise by remote detonation and must be replaced for the remainder of the tour.Enter cool and cocky loose-cannon Staff Sergeant (SSG) William James (Jeremy Renner). Filling Thompson's inherited shoes is not James intention, his entirely indifferent attitude to the situation makes him quite and enigma to his new comrades. The hotter the situation, the cooler he becomes.When the team is called to the scene of a suspicious abandoned car, SSG James slowly follows the red wires but refuses to follow the rules. To the displeasure of Sergeant Sanborn, James strips off his astronaut style protective Kevlar suit to be more comfortable and removes his headset obscuring communication leaving his team to support him blind. As one tense situation is resolved; another begins.Fueling the dissention forming in the ranks, Sanborn and Eldridge battle with the question; Does their reckless ""red-neck trailer-trash"" leader have a death wish or is he simply that good? Can James forge team camaraderie and get them through the remainder of the tour alive?Departing from the modern gung-ho American clichés of glamorized war movies, this stark adrenaline filled film doesn't explain whether war is just or necessary nor does it attempt to give reason to impenetrable geopolitics of the Middle East. It is just content to be deeply grounded in the language of humanity and mans inner turmoil under severe pressure in extraordinary circumstances.Deserving of its Avatar matching nine Oscar nominations, The Hurt Locker is wonderful scripted by first-hand-experienced screenwriter and journalist Mark Boal, beautifully shot utilizing hand-held cameras, grainy textures and washed out colourings and superbly, effortlessly and searing acting by a cast of obscure and relatively unknown actors.As The Times eloquently states this is a ""near perfect movie"" owed in large part to its female director Kathryn Bigelow. The supremely masculine story clearly benefits from Bigelow's feminine touch. Excusing the testosterone fueled explosions of most films in its topic favoring a more slow burn action. The timely introduction of black humor and snorting satire and its delicately handed exploration of the raw male psyche opens the gripping window into its nerve-shattering world. The films flaws are minor. A cohesive string tying the harrowing moments together is missing and the films path is unsatisfying unfocused. Three scenes in particular; an unrequited redemption, a superficial explanation and a trite death, are out-of-kilter and feel unconnected to the overall tone. The Verdict: It has been said ""War is a drug .. A force that gives us meaning"". This film grabs viewers by the scruff-of-the-neck and drags them through the layers and dimensions of war. Meticulously authentic, the white-knuckle action consummately embodies the throbbing anxiety, paranoia and dread of its terrifying cat-and-mouse subject.Published: The Queanbeyan AgeDate of Publication: 26/02/2010",Joanna B,4.5

Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty give out some fantastic performances that bring out a spark to this movie. The characters are very memorable and they felt like real people. The writing by Mark Boal is well written and it sounds realistic to what the characters are saying. The action is really good and is very realistic from what the soldiers do to get out of the situation. The plot is really good, and it has some tense moments. The movie shows how much it can change a soldier that they either want to go home to their family, or stay in the war because not many people can do it.

556,5-Mar-13,944578708,"PlotThe plot of The Hurt Locker is very original. The plot follows the last thirty days of a bomb squad rotation in Iraq. Through out the last days the team is caught up in fire fights, IED's and two replacements. There is no real enemy - yes there are the terrorist - but the enemy is really the emotion of the soldiers and their conflicts. There's a few surprises which always include the suspenseful IED moments.Awards WonThe Hurt Locker also won the 2008 Best Picture Oscar Award. I think that the award was justified. The Hurt Locker has amazing sound and editing as well as the plot with a story most people didn't even knew that existed.ThemesI think there is no overall theme to the movie but, it does lead an impression on the viewer. That impression is the hatred of terrorist, the movie is very emotional especially the IED scenes. The director does a great job showing this throughout the music and the people that were harmed or killed.Technical ElementsI think that the movie has amazing audio. Whether it is the breathing of the soldiers, or the amazing music that is so suspenseful. The audio is very cool as well as the battle scenes. In those scenes the lens is dirty and slightly out of focus which I like adding to suspense. I thought the movie was very well edited.ConclusionOverall I thought The Hurt Locker was a great very well edited war drama. I think this would be a great movie night movie.-AS, 8th Grade Student",Skyview B,4.5

686,21-Dec-12,914544340,"I may upset many people by saying this, but I believe this film to be one of the most over-rated movies of all time. Let's start off by clearing one thing up - I am not at all saying this is a bad movie, it's nicely directed, powerfully acted, with a decent and realistic use of special effects which do not completely dominate screen presence. It does give a strong representation of the Iraq war, yet throughout the film I found myself detatched. It never absorbed me deep enough to overcome some of its drawn out scenes, it was almost like what was there was a good basis, yet there was not enough emotion, tension, or gritty reality to keep me enthralled. It is certainly not a bad war film, but I have seen a wealth of better ones. And I must say, when comparing this to Cameron's Avatar, this robbed that film of its well-deserved Oscars.",Ellis W,3

I felt that Jeremy Renner's character was a moron who somehow made it in and out of bootcamp and his foolishness remained unscathed. There was a scene where he was disarming a bomb in a car and when his team told him to get out of the car so that they could regroup he chose to stay and disarm the bomb for no reason other than, as the movie says, for the adrenaline rush. That's right. He chose to risk his life for no other reason other than an adrenaline rush. I know that this movie was trying to say that ""war is a drug"" and to that I say BULLSHIT! War may be a part of what a soldier is, but war is not a drug. War is HELL. Those who want to go to war have never truly been there before. One other thing I hate about this movie is that it makes out war to be filled with all this action (which wasn't even entertaining) and that the military is filled with incompetent morons who don't even know how to take a simple order of staying alive. Seriously Jarhead was more entertaining than this trash. Jarhead didn't even have a single action scene,The soldiers were more intelligent and IT WAS BELIEVABLE! Avoid this movie.",Zachary C,0.5

""The Hurt Locker"" is also a lot more understated than I had originally anticipated, opting to focus more on its characters and their situations rather than its plotting.

799,20-Oct-12,922216650,"Overrated to say the least, The Hurt Locker launched Jeremy Renner into stardom... and to this day, I have no idea why. The film tries to justify his character by not only making him a rogue-ish bomb dismantler, but also needing to have a character outright say that he is a ""wildman"" in a complimentary way, as if the audience didn't already get that idea after the first 45 minutes into the film. His character just seemed like an uninteresting jerk the whole way through (other than the fact that he dismantles bombs and is good at it, we get it). There is also a scene where he fights his fellow compatriots, wrestling them to the ground with his bare hands for no apparent reason other than to establish his character as a rebel. He's a smug jagoff that likes getting himself into terrible situations because he simply can't live without being on the edge, and that's really all the film is about. There's no character arc for him, and there's no real payoff for the audience since it ends just about the same way it starts. It is bereft of feeling and emotion for a war film that should contain both of these things. The gritty realism and excellent production for the movie is impressive, but for me, the movie just couldn't get off the ground.",Patrick R,2.5

518,8-Apr-13,943525321,"After ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" I never thought that another filmaker would make a war movie that managed to get to their feets ... Kathryn Bigelow succeeded in a FANTASTIC way.""The Hurt Locker"" can be one of the best war movies of all time, explore and show's the Iraq war in a way never seen before, getting to be quite original in many details. One of the most positive and original points on the film is that it dosen't focuss attention on shootings sequences as other war films do, but explores the view of the soldiers, as they see and feel the war, putting the public on their places. Who sees the war on television or news, just see unnecessary killing and massacre between peoples and nations, yeah it is true but then people say that the soldiers are murderers. The film manages to explore this sense from the perspective of the soldiers, they are only there to follow rules, their job is being there, the soldiers only have each other and fight to protect the man on their side, we see that they count the days they spend in combat to return home soon which seems impossible. Mark Boal gets conveying this with a superb screenplay, shows reality in an impressive way. Not only is the screenplay is very real but also the impressive visual details that the film delivers.Another plus point in the film are the visual effects, giving the film an visual magnitude, impressive in every passing moment, and with the direction of Kathryn Bigelow everything is just amazing.The cast could not have been better for the story of these soldiers. Jeremy Renner gives a fantastic performance in every detail as Sergeant First Class William James; Anthony Mackie as Sergeant JT Sanborn and more; Brian Geraghty; Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes.From start to finish, ""The Hurt Locker"" gives an impressive view of the war in Iraq, stuffed maintenance; emotion; action and an impressive visual spectacle, one of the best war movies ever made.",Raphael Georg K,5

515,10-Apr-13,949486206,"This is a movie about bombs. Lots of bombs. Desert bombs.The End.That's pretty much it. Oh sure, a few other things happened. You wanna hear about 'em? OK. I'll provide you with a little more, oh faithful reader.I'm still not sure what the title The Hurt Locker refers to. It's not about well-secured first aid kits, nor is it about gymnasium facilities for actors William, John, or even Mary Beth.This celluloid endeavor was directed by Kathryn Bigelow; the deft hand behind such legendary screen classics as Point Break and Blue Steel. It stars Jeremy Renner as Staff Sergeant William James, an expert at diffusing bombs. Joining him on the Explosivity Disposaling Unit are Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Owen Eldrige (Brian Geraghty)Renner has been nominated for an Academy Award for his performance. I'm not sure why this is. The supporting performances - most notably Mackie's - were, in my opinion, superior. All Renner did was act ""cool"". Oh, so ""cool"". Desert ""cool"". But if looking ""cool"" is the only criterion used for award recognition, then David Caruso should be nominated for a Nobel Prize.The film centers mostly on the antics of Sergeant James. James loves dismantling things that can blow you into a zillion pieces. He'd rather do that than live a peaceful life in a nice home with his beautiful wife. We're shown some of his domestic life, but the movie doesn't show the good stuff. No. Instead we see him cleaning out the eavestrough of his house.Now I've cleaned out a few roof gutters in my time, but the one depicted here has to be the gunkiest gutter in the history of home maintenance. And he's cleaning it out with his bare hand!!! C'mon, use a scoop, or a trowel, or a toy shovel, a stick, a shoe, anything. I'd rather diffuse bombs in Iraq than have to clean out that gutter in that fashion.Another scene worth mentioning shows the guys - after getting a little snockered - engaging in an activity where good judgment and mental acuity would be a distinct disadvantage. The ""game"" involves taking turns hitting each other as hard as possible in the stomach. My wife, while watching this powerful and touching scene, turned to me and asked, ""Why do men do those kind of things?""You know, we men just have to chuckle when women ask us such questions. It was obvious to me, but I patiently explained it to her that this was a gesture of endearment. Women hug. Men try to smash the bejabers out of each other. It's their way of saying, ""You're OK in my book."" And nothing says it better than a ruptured spleen.A word of warning here to those prone to seasickness: the camerawork in this film is of that hand-held style that so many directors are wont to use these days. I suppose they feel it gives their movies that gritty, realistic, documentary look - which is ironic, since documentary filmmakers rarely use the technique anymore. Besides, if it's supposed to look realistic, then why don't I see the real world that way through my eyes? Although if I did, I'd be making an appointment - and pronto - with an ophthalmologist or a brain surgeon.If you have a tough time watching this film due to that camera style, then avoid The Bourne Ultimatum at all costs. You would not survive. Its visuals are worse than any bone-jarring experience you could imagineI once took a ride on a gigantically tall roller coaster. Its peak disappeared into the clouds. It was called the Red Ripper, or the Brown Streak, or the Green Puker - something like that. Anyway, all I know is that I was smiling after that ride. I wasn't smiling after The Bourne Ultimatum.In closing, I should say that even though I had some reservations about renting the DVD of The Hurt Locker, I was able to take something positive from it - a lesson.The lesson learned is, pay attention to your reservations.",G Thomas B,2

The Hurt Locker tries by giving us the perspective from a bomb removal unit, instead of the usual old infantry ground-pounder stuff. While I appreciate that, there are also too many flaws for the movie to draw me in, including characters acting in such a strikingly unprofessional way as to undermine my suspension of disbelief, downright cliché that are masked but not as cleverly as the director thought (yes, the Americans just has to save those Brits, huh?) and the eternally annoying shaken-camera style and fast editing that is supposed to mimic documentary-style work, but only serves to chop the narrative up and make it really hard to follow what is happening during the action scenes.",Mikael H,3

175,1-May-15,901197883,"Monday, December 20, 2010(2008) The Hurt LockerWAR ""The Hurt Locker"" or a ""Soldier's Journal"", starts out with a new recruit for this particular group, and his name is Sergeant First Class William James, played memorably by Jeremy Renner, since the other ""Bomb Tech"" got killed in action! I have to say in terms of the emotions, atmosphere or the experience, it felt quite real because this is ""only"" accordingly to ""one"" particular group and only one guy, who does not have a political agenda whether or not they should be there on the front lines or not, but what they're assigned to do, and is still a job no matter how big the risks are! It is a 24 hour job because ""one"" would not know when one is ever needed to undetonate an explosive device and it is something any sane person would not want to look forward to. But as the movie progressed, the only way this person were to confront this, as the other two soldiers observed while working alongside with him is to ""psyche"" yourself out as sort of an adrenline rush because your life can be gone in an instant! One of the most powerful lines here was when the star of the film says, ""we need more bomb techs here in Iraq"" because this job is not at all appealing! And although the movie is plotless, the experiences about a single persons journey toward war is very accurately portrayed here, since most of them spend much of their life living on a thread, and is not like spending it on the Bahamas sunbathing in the sun. And upon returning to the US for a tempory leave to spend some quality time with his family, that it was like coming back to a whole new world all over again, and hard for Will to adjust back to a life of normacy, when at the same time, knows that he still has to go back to a war that doesn't seem to end!  Also what this movie provides are what would happened if a soldier were to leave it's compound, and they're also some hazing. And although, drinking alcohol may not be too accurate, it could be a reflection of previous wars Americans had experienced, such as when the US army were fighting in Vietnam or in WWII against the Japanese and Germany!  I wanted to give this film a much higher rating, but I feel that the first incident was 100% avoidable which regards holding up a cell phone, and the soldier Sergeant JT Sanborn played by Anthony Mackie who was pointing a gun at this guy told him to put it down and instead of just either shooing him or shooting the phone on his hand, for some strange reason he just allowed him to continue to press the buttons on his phone anyway, causing the explosion to go off! But the reason for this was to introduce the Jeremy Renner character!If I was asked whether or not it deserved ""Best Picture"" as well as a bunch of other Oscar awards! And the answer is- ""yes"" it does, because it is the first film I had ever saw from the perspective of a soldier and not accordingly to some high official general sitting behind a desk if the war is controlled onto the desert field!CONTAIN SPOILERSI've just recently purchased this film and would have to say that the last 20 minutes of the film is the most powerful I had ever saw about the desert war, one of few scenes regards a conversation with his wife, and Will wants to just have something to talk about, but doesn't really have anything to tell her except about his war experiences, and she obviously does not want to hear about young kids blowned up by some suicidal bomber and instead says 'chop these carrots for me', there's also a social commentary about why soldiers can't make bonds with the peaceful civilians living amongst them while fighting because if they have a rapport with some of them and then get killed by some senseless attack, may take a toll on the soldiers lives or feel guilty about it! And would have to say that the ending is one of the most strongest I had ever saw, because at the beginning of the film, Soldier Will starts to counts the number of days until his next leave to see his family and then at the end of the film, after staying with them for a few days or weeks, he had to go back again, back to the sidelines starting his count this time from 365 Days left for his next leave, if he lives that is!  3 out of 4",Dave J,4

172,11-May-15,919478575,"Even though the war in the Middle East has calmed down a bit in recent years, it is still a touchy subject. So it was a bold move for Kathryn Bigelow to delve into the heart of the war in the war drama, ""The Hurt Locker"". Based on real-life accounts, this film follows the story of a fictional bomb disposal squad in Iraq.For a movie about war, it's surprising how beautiful ""The Hurt Locker"" is. Not only is the film beautifully shot, but the dramatic story-telling is also quite beautiful. Don't get me wrong though, this is still very much an action film, and every time Sgt. James suits up, the movie becomes suspenseful and intense.Much of the beauty of ""The Hurt Locker"" is the result of the outstanding cast of the film. Jeremy Renner delivers an excellent performance as Sgt. James, bringing the right amount of cocky, crazy, and endearing to his character. Likewise, Anthony Mackie (Sanborn) and Brian Geraghty (Eldrige) give equally enjoyable supporting performances.Though ""The Hurt Locker"" sometimes pushes the boundaries of belief (i.e. if an actual soldier disobeyed orders and went rogue the number of times Sgt. James does, he would be dishonorably discharged), the film is overall a very accurate account of the war in Iraq. It is sad at times. It is happy at times. It is terrifying at times. But regardless of the mood, it is a heavy film. But I think what sells me the most on ""The Hurt Locker"" is its unexpected ending, which is great and an interesting choice.",Stephen Z,4.5

The pressure to get the right shot, the dedication of staying in the same position with an assault rifle even though your getting tired, and the relationships you make with the friendly native people. One part I loved was when James and Sanborn were concentrating on taking out the enemies from far away in the two windowed building, the amazing shot of the fly going in James' eye. You definitely sensed the concentration and dedication in the young sergeant. I can understand Jeremy Renner's Oscar nomination. I wonder if we will ever see him with one again, or will he (god forbid) become the next James Bond. I can definitely see why and how this film won best picture, but I still would've voted for Avatar. I now have no reason to be mad that this one best picture.

865,27-Aug-12,876916396,"Well, I tried again to watch this riveting Oscar winner. I don't know why it's shot like a music video - I don't know why so many music videos are shot in a way that is antithetical to the way the human brain takes in information through the eye - and I don't know why it doesn't seem to bother so many people - but it makes the screen unwatchable for me. It is not an intellectual choice on my part, although I can use my intellect to analyze the problem.I might even be able to manage if it was just the fast cutting...or just the faux-photojournalist stitching, as in let's pretend that the audience is the cameraman, and so we see the camera zooming in and out as if it were trying to choose its focus...but these two together completely pull me out of the story - makes me want to scream - stop playing with the camera and let me see what is going on!Greenblatt says it makes the viewer feel like he is in the war zone, and I guess Bigelow feels that way too, but no one I know who's been in a battle agrees with them.The brain always tries to settle in on a picture so that it can figure out what is going on - yes, that is difficult to do in battle, but the brain makes an effort, and effort that is made impossible here, because the camera (via the camera work itself and the multi-angle cutting) forces, as it were, the eye to flit quickly from one impossible angle to another.On the other hand, if I have to watch this kind of camera work and editing, in its style it seems to me about as well done as is possible, on its own terms.In every other way, for my money, it's a stunning film. In particular, I like the use of silence, the composition of the story itself, the utterly natural dialogue that yet moves the story along without showing its stitches at all (completely opposite from the camera work in that regard), as well as the oft-praised acting and directing.My friend and excellent young filmmaker Alex Keipper in his review made an interesting point about the theme, which is explicitly stated at the film's outset, and well developed. I have many thoughts on the subject, which I won't go into here, except to say that for me it is a little too pat an explanation to say that some men are attracted to battlefield as a 'drug'...Robert Capa was famously disdainful of the comment.There is truth in it, no doubt, but it smacks a little of the bourgeois, of the outsider looking in. If a man feels more alive in the face of danger, a feeling I've experienced myself, perhaps the problem is not in the so-called addiction, but in what is missing in the world 'back home'. Something starkly and poetically suggested in the supermarket scene, shelves stuffed banally with ridiculous deserts masquerading as childrens' breakfasts. Which scene, indeed, is the more surreal?...the young Iraqi boy hawking pirated DVDs, or the blandness of abundance such that food itself has been made into entertainment, and American popular music, one of the great cultural gifts to the world, is reduced to the dullest possible orchestration to create a Muzak to shop by?",Erich R,4

325,7-Mar-14,784987897,"First it was Departures, and now this. Yet another movie that could have been great...if only a good 30 minutes was cut from its runtime. The Hurt Locker has fantastic action scenes which are extremely suspenseful, very funny and witty dialogue, solid character development, great cinematography, and a brilliant ending. Unfortunately with its 2 hour and 10 minute runtime, the film drags, and the action scenes start to lose its excitement. While I'm not always a huge advocate of 3 act structure, this is a film that 3 act structure purists can have a field day with criticizing. When the film hammers on action scene after action scene after action scene after action scene, you're pretty much climaxed out. When the film stops the action for a dialogue scene, it's such a welcome change. It's too bad, because this is a film that wants to show the day to day life of a bomb technician, therefore a 3 act structure would not work. At an hour and a half, this would have been a much better movie and not tired the audience out. The Hurt Locker is an Iraq war movie with no political agenda. It's simply about the life of a guy who disarms bombs and happens to be really good at it. Every single time he goes to work, there's a good 50/50 chance he won't make it out alive. As an action movie, it is probably the best of any movie this year. It's unpredictable, you really don't know who will make it out alive which makes it more suspenseful. I know some people may complain about the shakiness of the camera, but it gives you the, ""It feels like you're there"" feeling. The cinematography is brilliant. Often the film shows you exactly what the soldier can see which makes it even more intense. The soldiers know about as much as we do about who are the bad guys and who are the innocent civilians in Iraq. You can feel the fear that the soldiers are experience. There's moments which include showing us the POV of looking through a sniper rifle. The vision is so blurry, you can't make out what is out there, but it looks like it could be an Iraqi who could be holding a sniper rifle aiming at you...or maybe not. What should the soldier do? The movie shows all the uncertainties of day to day life of serving in Iraq, which adds to the suspense. The acting in general is all very good. The dialogue is full of witty zingers, and the main character is very interesting. All the character work is very well done. His backstory, his life back in the U.S, his collection of souvenirs is all great stuff. After a while you kind of want the action to end to show a little more of the soldiers as people.This movie is very well done in all areas and has many memorable moments. But if you ask me whether I have any desire to see the whole movie again, I'd probably say no. On DVD, I may skip to certain scenes, but I wouldn't wanna watch it all over again.It really is too bad, because none of the content was bad. It's all great stuff, but believe it or not, action scenes going non-stop can get tiring. It was frustrating watching this. The first 40 minutes in, I thought I was watching one of the best films of the year. Close to the 2nd hour, I was wondering when it was going to end. Don't let me dissaude you. This is still a very well done movie and I fully encourage everyone to see it. With the huge critical praise, you may feel disappointed if you end up liking it, but not loving it.",Jeff C,4.5

329,1-Mar-14,796187809,"""The Hurt Locker"" is the best American war film since ""Three Kings."" Its the first successful non-documentary Iraq War movie that shows us the continuous, life-threatening danger faced by an Army bomb squad. Kathryn Bigelow uses her action director skills to maximum effect to create an intense, visceral experience of war. The squad is in constant fear of survival but goes about their routine tasks of trying to diffuse bombs while keeping an eye out for civilians who could trigger the explosive device. There is a phenomenal sequence of the restlessness before a shootout. The movie bogs down a bit near the end when a solider goes on an investigative mission and the trio searches for a suicide bomber in enemy territory. The concluding segment of a soldier's struggle to adapt to life with his family is moving in its simplicity. A great film with terrific performances, most notably by Jeremy Renner.

204,7-Feb-15,837155450,"THE HURT LOCKER is a tense but emotionally distant war film from director Kathryn Bigelow, and starring Jeremy Renner. It follows an Army bomb disposal unit around as they do their job in war-torn Iraq. Unlike most war films it doesn't really take a stance on whether or not we should even be there, instead focusing on the psychology of warfare and what it does to the human mind. I thought that this approach mostly worked, although it kept the audience at a certain distance emotionally from the characters. The main character is played by Jeremy Renner, and he is the sergeant in charge of the unit. He is brash, reckless and one could almost say he has a death wish. What is closer to the truth is that he just loves what he does, and the thrill he gets from doing it. Also in his unit are another sergeant and a specialist played by Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty, respectively. They serve as counterpoint to Renner's character, and as a rational check against his unbridled nature. While most of the film deals with their bomb-defusing exploits, there are some moments when the true ugliness of the Iraq War shows its face, such as a tense nighttime scene in which Renner's character stalks someone he thinks is responsible for the death of a young street vendor he met. He ends up in the wrong place and just leaves before the situation escalates. It is in moments like that where the film hints at a possibly deeper reading of the film in terms of whether we should have even been in Iraq in the first place. That being said, the film is well-acted by everyone involved and the handheld cinematography worked in its favor, putting the viewer into the heat of the situations that arose. I guess my biggest gripe would be that it never explicitly challenges American presence in Iraq, but it's not necessarily a film's job to do that for you. With what it portrayed, and who the main character was, it still allows you to draw your own conclusions. For one, it must take a special someone to be a bomb disposal expert. And also, not everyone is cut out for combat. Overall, THE HURT LOCKER is a solid piece of filmmaking and an interesting look into modern warfare.",Robert H,4
207,30-Jan-15,968769303,"The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug. From the very first scene of this film, it's clear that it's a cut above the cookie cutter action films which Hollywood pumps out on assembly lines nowadays. Just how far is unclear until further along in the film, but if the first scene isn't enough to grip you like a vice, I don't know what is. Staff Sergeant William James, played with beautiful restraint by Jeremy Renner, is a bomb tech in Iraq, not the best combination. However, unlike most normal people, Will finds bombs a rush, a thrill, almost a turn-on. Each time he goes out, it seems as though he's having more fun than at any point in time. This becomes even more apparent towards the end of the film, where he tries to connect with his wife and child by telling them horror stories of Iraq. He fumbles with his other relationships, with his wife, with his team members, with the local kid selling dvds, though he's solid as a rock when it comes to being less than a foot from a live explosive. Renner plays this role pitch perfect the whole way through the film, whether he's calling his wife or lighting up what might as well be a post-coital cigarette after a hair raising, nail biting experience with a bomb. The film, though it's war film, steers clear of the politics of why the troops are there in the first place, opting instead to show what's happening to the boys who are over there. And how perfectly it shows this, from Sanborn's emotional breakdown after a particularly harrowing experience (to say any more would mean spoilers), to James' loss of composure during a house raid, the script is a perfect balance between smarmy and heartbreaking. Brian Geraghty's performance as Specialist Owen Eldridge is worth a special mention. Every time he's onscreen he inhabits his character entirely. When he tells his psychologist what's playing on his mind and when he mourns the victims of a bomb blast, he is perfect in both situations. But it is the set pieces which make the movie the movie which may actually beat Avatar. Each one is gripping, a thriller movie in itself where the outcomes are unclear, everyone is a suspect and every moment could be someone's last. The movie does little more than follow the everyday movements of Bravo company, but each day is more intense than the last. And the ending is perfect. There could be no other option for how this film could finish. In fact, I would have felt cheated if everyone had lived happily ever after, and the fact that you left wondering not only how crazy Will really is, but whether his luck is still within the best before date. Defining Scene: An illegally parked car sparks a whole set of problems. Or the one where case hardened steel causes a major incident.",Thomas B,5

75,5-Jul-16,913749999,"A very specific selection from the quote that opens the film, taken from Chris Hedge's ""War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning"", sums up the next 133 minutes of Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker in just four words: ""war is a drug."" It's a sentiment that mirrors the mindset of Jeremy Renner's Staff Sergeant William James, who is fearlessly calm in coordinating his EOD squad. Too calm, perhaps, to the point where his actions continuously risk his own life, and the lives of his fellow squad members, including Anthony Mackie's by-the-book Staff Sergeant JT Sanborn and Brian Geraghty's emotionally naive Owen Eldridge. It's a war film, but at its core, Mark Boal's screenplay is a character study of how war affects everyone: as their tour of duty winds down, these three soldiers and their worldviews are changed quite drastically as tensions continuously rise. The film lacks a single, overarching plot, which occasionally hurts the film's pacing, but allows for plenty of character moments between Renner, Mackie, and Geraghty, all of whom give strong performances.Kathryn Bigelow directs the film with a sense of raw and gritty viscerality, especially when the story necessitates intense action sequences. Bigelow understands how the war works: there's no huge shootouts with running-and-gunning and constant explosions from entire militaries here. Between the handheld camerawork and the general lack of a noticeable musical score, the EOD bomb disposal scenes are filmed in a way that feels like a guitar string is being wound too tight, and could snap at any minute. They're slow paced, but deliberately, and effectively so. It's as if we're stuck down in the sandy streets of Baghdad with these soldiers, and there's no telling who's going to come out of each mission in one piece.This Best Picture and Best Director winning film (Bigelow is the first, and currently the only, female to win both of these awards) is simultaneously a phenomenal war film, with perhaps the strongest onscreen portrayal of the Iraq War to date, and a fascinating character study of the effects of said war. The Hurt Locker is a must-see.",Andrew M,4

660,6-Jan-13,943265682,"The war in Iraq has taken many lives; because, as youâ(TM)d expect, itâ(TM)s very dangerous. Yet nothing is quite as dangerous as working in a bomb disposal unit. For a bomb disposal unit, there are all sorts of safety precautions; however renegade Sergeant William James, a reckless man who frequently risks the lives of his unit, disregards almost every precaution, as he descends further into addiction: an addiction to war.  The Iraq War was bloody, brutal and took no prisoners. Director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal portray the war stunningly accurately, with high-octane gunfights and nerve-shredding scenes that deliver the intensity of bomb disposing in heart-pounding fashion.  When you watch The Hurt Locker, a powerful war epic that follows a highly trained bomb disposal unit lead by Sergeant William James, you will find yourself enthralled and immersed in Bigelowâ(TM)s web of swearing, bombs, cigarettes and a bloody and high-octane war. Because from the nerve-wracking opening bomb disposal failure, to the emotional final ten minutes, Bigelow will have you perched on the edge of your seat, thirsty for more action.  Another huge positive that Kathryn Bigelow can boast about are the marvellous performances demonstrated by the cast. Anthony Mackie must get a mention thanks to his passionate portrayal of Sergeant J.T Sanborn and as does Brian Geraghty who shines brightly throughout the film, especially in a raging rant aimed at James, as Specialist Owen Eldridge, a man who is a tad emotionally unstable. However Jeremy Renner completely steals the show, portraying Sergeant William James, as he channels grit, sorrow and anger into one Academy AwardÂ (R) nominated performance. On the other hand I felt that there wasnâ(TM)t a clear storyline other than Sergeant William Jamesâ(TM)s character development which while itâ(TM)s interesting to watch, you will find yourself thinking that this isnâ(TM)t a war epic but a bloody and action-packed account of his life. Yet, the storyline problem can be forgotten, because when the battles are the so immersive and action-packed, though not quite up to the high standards of sheer brutality shown in Saving Private Ryan, the battles alone make this film a hit. Taking everything into account, The Hurt Locker boasts a gritty, heart-pounding and intense portrayal of the Iraq War that whilst it doesnâ(TM)t have a sufficient storyline or climax, is made up for with some rather sweet and satisfactory action and three enchanting performances.",Hector C,4

His war story provides some tragic and dramatic moments and tense, action-packed scenes, resulting in the best representation of the war... in Iraq, because in general the best war film goes to ""Apocalypse Now"". His script is quite powerful, because it was written by Mark Boal, who has lived this experience and transmitted in a fictional story, and it is very well done in terms of the narrative of the story, as well as the dialogues that have their characters . The performance shows enough talent to enhance the characters assigned, especially Jeremy Renner who is (as I believe) the perfect role for him. I conclude by saying that the direction and execution of Katheryn Bigelow, is excellent for this kind of movies, she should keep doing work worthy of war and thriller hereafter. I must say that ""The Hurt Locker"" is an interesting piece of cinema, with very good performance and a specialized script, surprise (but worthy) to win the Academy Award.",Ronald N,4.5

548,14-Mar-13,940806108,"There is a scene in ""The Hurt Locker"", perhaps twenty or so minutes long, where Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), James (Jeremy Renner), Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) and the rest of the Bravo squad are engaged in a sniper battle with some Iraqi refugees.It's the best, most action-packed, and most epic battle I've ever seen in a movie, and none of the characters move more than three feet.This, we realize, must be how war is actually like. No running, and jumping and shooting and blowing or any of that. These slow, precise, suspenseful battles. How did they manage to get it so realistic?Well, it certainly helped director Kathryn Bigelow that her screenwriter, Mark Boal, was a war veteran. He knows firsthand what the deal is in Iraq and how to put it into a movie.The Hurt Locker's co-stars are Ralph Fiennes (we know him from his role as Voldemort), Guy Pearce (from L.A. Confidential) and Evangiline Lilly as James's wife. My favorite parts of the movie were when James's rebellious attitude clashed with Sanborn's by-the-book attitude, and while that seems like a cliche, it's presented in a different way in this movie.In one such scene, the team is about to blow up a building when James realizes he forgot his gloves at the bombing site. He grabs a truck and drives down to get them. As he's dancing around next to the bombs with the gloves in his hands, screaming, ""I found them!"", Sanborn's hand tightens around the detonator button. He is pushed to his limit.Bottom Line: The whole cast and crew actually flew to and shot the movie in Iraq, on location, and that couples with the experienced screenwriter make it easy to see how The Hurt Locker won the award for best picture.",John S,5

998,20-Jun-12,906398954,"Right out the gate all the hype was high. ""One of the great war movies"" invites all viewers to come forth with certain expectations: Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, or whatever their favorite is. It' not all about hype, and since word of mouth can be often way off, sometimes it is dead on. When this movie was over I felt that I had missed something. Maybe I just didn't feel what I was supposed to. I can say it is not even in my Top 5 war movies. I named 3 of my five above, and Locker does not even begin to compare to these. It may sound as if I am dismissing this picture completely but that is not the case. I have allowed the messages and images to soak into my mind and over time it has grown on me more. This will have to viewed again because even though I can follow the adrenaline junkie bomb unit I still can't see what all the fuss is about.  Renner was definitely able to pull off a great role and he deserved his Oscar nom. I feel like we will see more great roles for him in the future. One of the last scenes is what made the whole experience worthwhile: the scene at the cereal aisle in the supermarket. I really hope Renner continues to pursues powerful roles like this. As far as direction goes, I also feel that Bigelow deserves her credit too. I think she has come a long way since her last good film (the entertaining Point Break) and has definitely brought her best work to light. Pierce and Fiennes bring various mixes to the project since they are pretty powerful as far as cameos go. All together is has a good lead role and the rest is pretty basic war drama. The story is brought to a boil over time and it has the potential to explode. When it didn't I was left to admire what I could.  I would estimate this is well above Jar Head but below even Black Hawk Down or We Were Soldiers. Maybe I'm the victim of hype because I'm standing almost completely alone on this one. It just didn't have the intensity I wanted and ultimately came up shorter than what I envisioned for it. ***After a 2nd viewing, I'm taking this up to a 4/5 (80%). I still do not see this as a masterpiece war film but it does shine at times, particularly the last 15 minutes in my opinion. Renner stole the show.",Craig T,4

121,8-Nov-15,870598536,"The Hurt Locker is about a bomb squad in the middle east. When their lead bomb tech is killed they are sent a replacement (Jeremy Renner) who is a bit of a hothead and a bit wild. The movie then shows the squad in many various situations that work to show the brutality of the war and how hard it is for the soldiers to cope with.Things I Liked:Jeremy Renner. Renner showed he could helm a film here. His work is mesmerizing to watch during the entire movie. The performance grabs you from the moment you meet his character and you can't take your eyes off of him, whether he is acting opposite other actors or alone on screen. Renner proves, through Hurt Locker, that he is a compelling and highly watchable actor.The Tone. Holy cats, this movie is tense! The opening ten minutes alone have you on the edge of your seat and you get put back there throughout the film. The movie shows that war is not action packed, and exciting, it's tense, it's boring at times, it's hard to deal with, the movie parallels that beautifully, you really get a sense that these men are constantly in danger and something could take them out at any moment. The tone carries the movie, sometimes more than anything else.Things I Didn't Like:The Plot. I found the first hour of this movie really compelling and then everything after that to be a bit of a rehash and somewhat unnecessary. The movie feels long after the first couple of big moments. You start to lose interest, which is hard to believe given how gripping and tense the movie is, especially in the beginning.Overall:Overall, the movie is a tense, gritty, drama that really shows how tough the soldiers in the middle east have it. The starring performance from Renner is fantastic and he can hold your attention alone for an entire two hours, the movie manages to really capture the perpetual tension of being in a war zone and makes us as the viewers really feeling like something could go wrong at any moment. The movie gets repetitive and long during it's second half and you start to lose interest but the movie works well overall. It really keeps you on edge and by the end you just need to shake off and do something fun because of how it grabbed you.",Preston L,3.5

765,5-Nov-12,901362913,"With The Hurt Locker, I ended up watching a very different film than I intended to. The plan was to sit down and enjoy a dramatic war movie with nuanced performance and subtlety; an Oscar contender. By the end though, I was watching a high suspense thriller that happens to take place in Iraq. It's not an insignificant difference, and it was one I needed to make before I could fully appreciate what I was watching. Expectation is often the bane of a viewer's existence, and that's never more true than when one finally watches an Academy nominee. The film was released on June 26th and Oscar-buzz began shortly thereafter. Ever since then, our unformed opinions have been molded by everything BUT the movie itself. I hate this for a number of reasons, but mostly because it's unavoidable. Either see it opening day, or go live in a cave. Otherwise you had better be prepared to do battle with the forces of subjective opinion, because brother, they're a-comin.The story circles three men serving time in the Army, specifically in an Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit. After a chaotic opener in which Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) lose their team leader (Guy Pearce) to a remote detonated IED, we meet the anomalous Staff Sergeant Will James (Jeremy Renner), whose approach to the work is savant-like and troublesome to his new team. Sanborn and Eldridge are counting the days to their discharge, just over a month remaining for both. James just wants to disarm bombs. As the days pace slowly, the three men suffer a number of harrowing moments, often gruesome and just as often terrifying. For Sanborn and Eldridge these episodes are all just glimpses at death, and Eldridge in particular seems just one more loud noise away from losing himself entirely. The direction for Geraghty's performance might have been, ""war is hell, and you're always at war."" James meanwhile, is always at a distance, seeming incapable of fear or even anxiety. It's apparent that he lives for the tension, that he thrives on it. Each bomb is another notch on the bedpost, and a calming cigarette usually follows a successful disarming. There's more to the plot, though I would hesitate to say it follows a story arch, more considering each characters path. Anyway, story is secondary to experience here.And experience seems nearly a character in this film. Occasionally we're thrust inside of James' protective helmet to see through his eyes and hear through his ears. It's claustrophobic and hot, and the drone of heavy breathing is a barrier to the sounds of the world. Sound isn't applied to scenes as much as it's painted in strokes. Occasionally the canvas is blank, just the muffled sound of city in the distance. Then swiftly we're immersed in the violent screams of battle and find ourselves longing for that silent tension. I would almost go so far as to say that director Kathryn Bigelow works better in short bursts than in constructing the whole. Though the film itself is vibrant, it's in shorter bursts that she seems most comfortable. Still, the script seems to account for this, with the story being told in something closer to vignettes than cohesive elements. The pieces speak to the whole, but don't necessarily define it.Most war movies are more or less about war. War is bad, war is heroic, war is chaos, etc. The Hurt Locker though seems to use war as just a setting. The action is familiar and the violence rivals any dramatic war film, but the point is not to examine war. The point is to examine fear. Watching this film you feel drenched in tension, with every scene comes a recognizable foreboding. It's familiar, though at first you can't decide why; there's certainly tension in war films, but this feels different. The strain of these scenes isn't just dramatic, but scary, and that's when the true nature reveals itself. This is a horror film. There's no abandoned old house, and most of the terror comes in daylight, but there's no mistaking this pattern of tension and release. You even find yourself wanting to scream at the characters, ""don't go in there!"" The camera reveals the film's most gruesome moments intimately, letting carnage play its role. This is without question a horror device, and adding to it the potential for truth in some of these ghastly moments, it's terribly effective. Most of us know the genre well enough to know you need some key elements. There is of course the character who's perpetually frightened, in our case Eldridge. There's Sanborn, the natural leader and obligatory good guy. And James, the character with some unnatural connection to the monster, an ambiguous, otherworldly kinship. Then there's the monster itself. The ghostly stalker of our main characters, casting its shadow of doom. In The Hurt Locker the monster is death, or fear of it.Aside from making a war movie something more than a war movie, Bigelow does a number of other things right. The cinematography is somehow both gorgeous and dirty, with the Iraqi landscape a haunting and captivating place. What occasionally feels like documentary footage can turn quickly into sublime photography, and it all serves the agitated arrangement. Her performances too are noteworthy, with not just a solid performance from Jeremy Renner, but really standout work from Anthony Mackie who seems to have gone entirely unnoticed. Towards the end of the film when Sgt. Sanborn finally breaks down, weary from the days and days after days and days, Mackie bursts through from the celluloid in one of the film's rawest emotional moments.Still, the film is not without jagged edges. While Renner's performance is good, it's also confused. His Sgt. James is initially a simple character with a complex motivation, but as the film rolls James has his moments of breakdown, just as everybody does, and to be honest, they fall a little flat. While I don't really need to see another character emotionally exhausted, I in particular want to avoid it with James, whose adrenaline junkie, fearless, cavalier persona is the perfect contrast to all the other war characters we're used to seeing. What makes him interesting is his disinterest, and by breaking that down the filmmakers seemed to lose direction a bit. Had James remained stalwart throughout, never feeling pain, never feeling loss, never feeling guilt, the character would have become the personification of wartime indifference. He still has these moments: when we recognize his only real drive is his next fix, or when he sheds his protective gear and states like an Eastwood character, ""If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die comfortable,"" but they're diminished by his fallibility, and the lost potential is frustrating.I suppose in general you could say that dialogue presents some small problems. Far too much happens on the surface here, patronizing the audience. I'm a firm believer in not placing a magnifying lens over your message or tying up your loose ends unless you absolutely have to. Nothing brings an eye roll like arriving at the point, then having to wait another thirty seconds for the film to arrive at it. I would name some examples of this within the movie, but it would feel a little defensive and unnecessary. Mildly trite dialogue is one of those things you either see or you don't, and unless it's terribly dramatic than it doesn't really hurt the final product all that much anyway.The inevitable question: Should this film win best picture? For my money I think Inglourious Basterds is the best film of the year. Possibly Up, and even Avatar feels like more of an accomplishment than The Hurt Locker. Certainly this film is good, with a moment or two that might transcend all others from 2009, but I just can't get behind a Best Picture win. I can't say for sure that my lack of enthusiasm might not be a byproduct of expectation, but I also can't do anything about it. I watched the same movie everybody else did, and this is what I thought about it. Stories, like characters, like themes, like images, like sounds, like songs, are fluid and given without explanation. This is the beauty of film, and perhaps too the burden. It's the x-factor and the element of the process you simply can't control. It's the reason the Academy Awards will, as always, be at least mildly frustrating. But it's also what makes the whole thing exciting and keeps it from being a science. It's the fickle charm of art.",Peter W,4

The murder of a young Iraqi who James was close with and the failed attempt of relieving an innocent man from a locked bomb vest.

I have no idea why this movie got so many awards, so many recommendations, so much critical praise. Is it a bad film? No, not at all. It's in fact rather good film, fully capturing the intensity of a bomb squad. I just wouldn't call it the best picture of the year, not even close.Still, it does some things very well. As stated, it is very intense from time to time. Every time one of the characters has to don on the bomb suit, the atmosphere picks up instantly. You can feel the claustrophobia, the detachment from the outside world, and I enjoyed those scenes very much. Most of the bomb situations are also creative and different enough to be interesting and I have to applaud the choice to film near actual war zone as it does add to the setting. It's a fine-looking film and the two sound-related Academy Awards were well-earned in my opinion.My biggest issues with this film lie with its characters. Director Kathryn Bigelow clearly tried to show us the detachment from reality that plagues these bomb squad members even outside their suits, but unfortunately I ended up being detached from them as well. I managed to form no connection with them, because none of them acted like a normal human being - at least in my opinion. They were there to illustrate a point, to act out the story and because they needed to be there, but they felt hollow and empty. At the end of the story I could say that I had enjoyed the scenery and some of the action scenes, but that I hadn't really learned anything new about war or its conditions.But perhaps that's just my failing as a viewer.

So you have to expect some of that.  I don't think it's perfect... I do believe it hammers home the point that SGT. James is a thrill seeker. And there were a few scenes that I did not like. One about 3/4 of the way through the movie where SGT. James leaves the base. It feels like a pointless detour to me.

255,8-Sep-14,900251038,"Extremely well-acted, ""The Hurt Locker"" shows the war like never before. Both Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie did an amazing acting job showing the two different personalities of their characters, one very serious and one that doesn't play by the rules and takes risks, However as we follow a bomb-defusing team it seems all too repetitive, I felt like I knew that every time they would survive. But I liked the fact that they steered away from the main plot and talked about the suicide bomber that ""wanted to live"", or how Jeremy Renner's character thought that Beckham died (the young boy that bonded with him). When I found out that Beckham was alive, I felt happy but I also understood how Jeremy Renner's character was upset that he had gone through all that trouble when he thought he had died. I think the acting and writing was amazing, and I also loved how Kathryn Bigelow made the movie seem realistic in the way that there were no musical cues letting us know that the character was alright because that doesn't happen in a war, in a war you are always fearful of dying, there are no theme songs, music or other cues in real life.

731,29-Nov-12,856478168,"After losing their team leader in an explosion two members of a bomb squad must work with his replacement and try to survive the final 39 days of their tour in Iraq.Katherine Bigelow brings us the best war movie of this Generation; The Hurt Locker follows three members of an elite bomb squad who are called out to clear IED?s out of the way for their fellow soldiers. It is a tense game of cat and mouse not knowing who is placing the bombs, how they are going to be detonated or how much time they will have to defuse them before an insurgent remotely detonates them. Jeremy Renner delivers a phenomenal performance as Staff Sergeant William James the new team leader who appears reckless and without care for his team. The inside look into what motivates these volunteers to join a bomb squad and perform one of the most dangerous positions in the army is simply astounding the combination of going into an unknown area against and unknown enemy and defusing these crude bombs will make you squirm in your seat as if you are there. The shot?s of the concussive blast from one of these bombs is visually amazing. The dynamic of Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Eldrige (Brian Geraghyt) who are counting down the days to leave Iraq conflicting with James who has defused hundreds of bombs and is not looking forward to leaving Iraq like the other two creates a mesmerizing conflict. The brotherhood they share as well as the discomfort of putting their life on the line in one of the deadliest situations possible is exhilarating to watch.With a great cast and excellent direction the Hurt Locker is a movie that everyone should see, especially given that this is a film that is based in reality, on situations taking place right now.",Chris H,4.5

If someone gets shot in the neck, even with a sniper, they aren't going to drop dead instantly (Don't believe me? watch the Zapruder film). This movie makes death clean and nice, which it isn't! If we are going to take war seriously, I want to see someone bleed out, go into shock, or suffocate like they would in real life. The great war films never shy away from blood and gore. Bigalow says Kubrick inspired her, but this was no Full Metal Jacket. Full Metal Jacket was gnarly, people got shot and suffocated in their squad mates arms. Squad mates tried tirelessly to revive friends who were already too far gone. This movie had none of that! I absolutely went ballistic when the British guy on the Humvee l got shot and everyone accepted that he was dead without having any possible way of knowing!! How on earth do they know he isn't alive! Good movie but will never be to comparable to Saving Private Ryan (which didn't win best picture despite being almost unanimously considered a better movie than the hurt locker), Full Metal Jacket, and Apocalypse Now.

631,16-Jan-13,787245875,"Kathryn Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker"" is a thrilling human interest story exploring motivation in the era of industrialized military adventurism.Framing voluntary continued participation in war as an addiction brings to light a method of maintaining sanity that has not been frequently explored in a serious war drama thus far. In a post-Vietnam era war where the U.S. military doesn't exactly know who the enemy belligerents are, i.e., it could be everybody or nobody, thrill seeking is as good a way as any to artificially maintain an even keel. The improvised explosive devices exacerbate that problem. Any object could be a bomb. Having a faceless enemy elevates the question of just why, exactly, were we fighting a war in Iraq. Who was the enemy? What was the real objective?Jeremy Renner's character SFC James' unconventional approach to war is highlighted by his Bravo Company partners, who take more typical approaches to the situations they find themselves in. Anthony Mackie's SGT Sanborn is a man who sees the value in sticking to the military structures that SFC James interprets a little loosely and Brian Geraghty's SPC Eldridge has lost much of the insulation protecting his nerves from the constant onslaught of life-endangering situations. As a result, they have slightly more functional difficulty with war than their team leader. This difference in approach also makes for some situational humor spurred by SFC James. Though it may feel like a humorous vestige of the civil society the soldiers grew up in, the recurring placement of the habitual nicety ""please"" is reflective of the artifice (questionable integrity of and shallow justification) of the whole Iraq situation. SFC James is a rogue technician in a rogue war in a formerly rogue middle eastern state. In this particular situation he is the normal one, not his more tentative team mates.Though that's not to say he doesn't have an arc. There is one iconic, but unsubtle scene where he showers after a mission with all his gear on. One can feel that the man wishes, in this moment, that the water would rinse away the weight of mistakes made, in addition to the blood that leaches off. The strength of Renner's performance as SFC James makes me want to see more of that character, which is unlikely because this isn't a popcorn film like ""The Bourne Identity"" or ""Casino Royale.""For this story, war mostly takes place in a medium density arid urban setting, rather than a continental countryside or a jungle somewhere in the global south. For each IED that Bravo Company attempts to disarm, whether successful or not, there is an audience. Folks of many walks tune into the grotesque magic shows now performing in the Baghdad public square. Will the magician disappear? Will the puppet master delight again?What makes this film so thrilling, in addition to being an engaging drama, is the expert depiction of urgent escalation and suspense. Using very effective cinematic techniques, Bigelow binds the audience to a fluctuating roller coaster of dread and immense tension. The editing and stylish speed manipulations help transport the audience to wartime Baghdad. The action that takes place and the visuals presented carry a wrenching visceral quality, translating the often remote brutality of war to the human body, in varying intensities and degrees of life endangerment. The pacing is pretty tight as well, responsibly toying with the audience's breath.The blend of fidget-cam and completely static shots is modulated to the intensity of the action on screen. It's still and clear when the characters have the luxury of precise examination and shaky and shallow in situations where they don't. Unlike other films that use constant camera shake to lend ""authenticity or grit"" constantly, as a baseline, this film uses it to obscure details for the audience when those same details are obscured for our characters by escalating situations. The constant assessment of where to focus your attention so that you might to fight another day translates perfectly.The production design is excellent and never looks cheap (to my lay eye). The weaponry and equipment used looks darn authentic. It lacks the plasticky/summarized look that many throwaway action films, with much larger budgets I might add, have. The suit that SFC James wears looks like the real deal, sweltering in the desert sun.Kathryn Bigelow's Peckinpah-ish chutzpah finally yielded Oscar gold with this film. She has portrayed macho men doing ridiculous things before, but didn't break through to critical adoration until now. Just as brilliantly written as ""Inglourious Basterds,"" not in terms of dialog, but in terms of symbolism and historical encapsulation and easily a rawer and less tried and true a story than Avatar, ""The Hurt Locker"" definitely deserved its Oscar for Best Picture, despite all the grumbling afterward. Mark Boal's highly detailed and satisfying script is a perfect compliment to Kathryn Bigelow's artful spunk. As a result, the film is an interesting hybrid of a ballsy and entertaining action film and a serious emotional drama focusing on a select group of people in some of the most intense situations possible. The film might not be perfectly realistic per se, but it feels completely true in terms of the parts of the human emotion spectrum it covers. Then again, criticizing a fictional film for its inaccuracy is like criticizing a painting for not being photorealistic. Interestingly, it feels much less Hollywood than ""Platoon,"" which, 26 years later, feels more like a counterpart to ""Predator"" than ""Apocalypse Now."" Though it may not be as triumphant as Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""The Hurt Locker"" is just as fitting a portrayal of the Iraq conflict, finding the elusive sweet spot between visceral intensity, intelligent writing, and a resonant topicality that stops well short of the preachiness that is so easy to fall into.As a man and his addiction come into focus, a current sense of our military-industrial complex follows suit.

469,7-Jun-13,367481606,"A US army bomb disposal tec makes waves in his new unit because of his gung ho attitude. The Hurt Locker is an interesting war film, mainly because its indie sensibilities make it a very unusual treatment of this subject for a product of the US movie making industry. It's quite a reserved, unsentimental film about the impact of a ""war"" that has no visible enemy; not quite in the same way as Jarhead in which the soldiers just could not find an army to face, but because the enemy hides itself in plain sight amongst the innocent population. This obviously causes great conflict within the soldiers, always unsure whether to fire or not to fire and seemingly never able to punish the perpetrators of the atrocities they witness on a daily basis. It thankfully avoids heavy-handed patriotic bullshit instead concentrating on the effects of the situation on each individual and the fine performances all round make for fascinating character study. The ""battle"" sequences are also very well staged, and although the dreaded shaky cam did irritate (the constant zoom switching and miscued shots are so obviously deliberate that it just made it feel even more fake rather than less) it is technically very accomplished on every level. The only faux pas for me was the closing scene in which ""our hero"" is striding purposefully back down a Baghdad road to a heavy metal riff which was a bit too John Wayne and seemed to be at odds with the tone of the whole of the rest of the film, but otherwise another quality war film about a very sensitive subject.",Super Reviewer    xGary X,3.5

466,12-Jun-13,901297811,"""The Hurt Locker"" will mold itself into the category of one of the greatest war movies of all time. It is arguably the most intense action film in the history of cinema. As of this date, it has won best picture at the Oscars, a title well deserved. It is the best live action film of 2009. And it is the second best movie of 2009 behind the documentary ""Tyson"". ""The Hurt Locker"" is director Kathryn Bigelow's fresh take on a military profession that is not based upon typical cliche, ""front-line"" gun battles. The film focuses on soldiers who are in charge of disposing roadside bombs; a job equally as important as any within the military. ""The Hurt Locker"" stars Jeremy Renner, a bomb disposal expert who lives vicariously through his job. He lives life in accordance with the theme of the film which states that ""war is a drug""; a very interesting idea about soldier mentality that has never really been explored in war films. At times he is cartoonishly wild and unpredictable in his methods, forcing co-star Anthony Mackie to try and hold his unit together on a 40 day tour of Iraq. Mackie wonderfully plays the straight man to Renner's loose cannon. The two are in conflict with each other, yet at the same time are surrounded by the hell on earth that is the Iraq War. Their co-existence is key to their survival and to the survival of their unit. War movies are mostly praised for their realism and ""The Hurt Locker"" is the most realistic portrayal of war that I've witnessed since the opening scene of Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"". We get an accurate glimpse of how intense and scary modern warfare really can be. This film is gripping and unpredictable. It is well acted and great to look at. At times you forget that it's a movie, it feels like your watching something more along the lines of a documentary. For example, no performance feels like a performance, the acting is that good. ""The Hurt Locker"" is a real achievement in film making and is such a leap above and beyond the crapfest of movies made in 2009. I take my hat off to Kathryn Bigelow who made a beautiful modern war epic that will stand the test of time. I would have given this film a perfect rating but I felt the film got really bumpy in its closing sequences and I wanted a bit more in the department of character development.

On another level, it's a metaphor for the addictive quality of violence in general -- a phenomenon that has produced what Pope John Paul II called a ""Culture of Death.""This is a hard movie to watch, but I'm going to be recommending it.

164,7-Jun-15,934786800,"87%Watched this film on 27/05/2013Hurt Locker is clearly one of the best films from director Kathryn Bigelow and it is the only film of her other than Point Break that I have seen. The Hurt Locker is tensely shot and well acted. Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie are great actors and you can occasionally see big guns such as Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce. One of the best shot scenes in the film is the opening scene where a grenade explodes when it is triggered by a cell phone. There is this awesome slow motion scene during that explosion, it is mind blowing. Hurt Locker is one of the best Iraq War dramas from Hollywood. Also there is a sniper shooting scene in the film which is extremely interesting and tense. The scene where Jeremy Renner detonates a series of bombs kept on the back of a car is a really tense situation.  Hurt Locker has some disturbing scenes such as a bomb inserted inside the body of a dead boy. I recollect an incident that occurred in India when Maoists killed Indian soldiers and stuffed their bodies with bombs. Bombs were surgically inserted into the soldier's bodies. The report was that the Maoists take inspiration from Hollywood movies. Anyway, the suicide bomber was scene was a big letdown and from there the film fails to get momentum and tension from there on. I don't really know what else I have to say about this film, so I am winding up.",Jayakrishnan R,4

167,25-May-15,953188119,"Wow. How much more Hollywood can you get? The Hurt Locker is a beloved and critically acclaimed movie that is regarded as the best Iraq war movie. Those critics obviously know nothing about the Iraq war. Where to begin? Well I'll start with the positives. The film is very atmospheric. The landscape looks just like Iraq. I felt thirsty just watching it. The acting is amazing, and the film can be quite entertaining. That being said, this had to be one of the most unrealistic and disrespectful war films I've ever seen. Jeremy Reiner's character displays soldiers as hot headed thrill seekers. Seriously, they would never let someone that reckless in the army. There's a reason the army is strict, that strictness saves lives! This dude is unreal. I mean please, the scene where he leaves his base without permission, breaks into a civilian's home, then moves back across Iraq at night and makes it back to his base unscathed? Get real. Come on, endangering his soldiers lives, assaulting civilians, leaving his post? How is this guy still in the military?! And don't even get me started on the sniping scene. Really? A group of soldiers roaming Iraq by themselves with no authority? Get real. An Iraqi soldier getting two one hit kills while sniping with an AK? Get real. This movie is Hollywood's version of the war. It's a complete spit in the face to the men and women of our army. It makes them look like smug, cocky thrill seekers when in reality, they're brave people doing a very difficult job. It lacks tension, credibility, and it's main character is so unlikable you can't wait to see him die. Will someone please tell me how this movie won best picture?",Facebook U,2

934,3-Aug-12,907599211,"THE HURT LOCKER is a amazing, gripping, suspenseful, thrilling, war drama that is a fantastic film. It's set in the war of Iraq a few years ago and shows what the soldiers have to go through to disarm explosives and fight for our country. War is a drug. The Hurt Locker does have many great things to give you. There are a few scenes where a soldier has to disarm a lot of bombs and explosives. It's very suspenseful and puts you on edge. You never know if he's gonna blow up or not. And there is a awesome scene were two groups of snipers shoot at each other. That scene was awesome. This movie is VERY realistic. Strangely though there wasn't a whole lot of blood. The way this movie is filmed is great, because it's presented more like a documentary then a actual movie. And there is no music in the background whatsoever which makes the bomb disarming scenes even more suspenseful. The acting is great and Jeremy Renners character is a funny, witty character that you hope doesn't die.The Hurt Locke is a fantastic movie that gives you a sense of how tragic and terrible war really is.

An onscreen quote opens the film proclaiming ""War is a drug"" and spends the next 2 hours with a single-minded purpose of explanation. What it does, it does very well, giving a first-person perspective into the variety of dangers that these soldiers encounter every day. There's no sermonizing about war, just a very matter-of-fact approach which is rather novel. However some of the connecting material between encounters is a little weak for a Best Picture winner, giving the movie's structure the feel of an intense video game. Jeremy Renner is a quality find as a foolhardy detonation expert. Kathryn Bigelow's shakycam directorial style is both an asset and a hindrance, as if she doesn't have complete mastery of her tools. Admittedly she too won a statue for her work, but I can think of a handful of other women more deserving of landmark Oscar recognition.",Super Reviewer    Doctor S,4
876,19-Aug-12,901338692,"Okay so here's the second movie that I was borrowing from my youngest brother along with Gladiator. So without further intro, let's get into The Hurt Locker.  Plot: Sergeant First Class William James becomes the leader of a Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit during post-invasion Iraq after the units former leader was killed by a bomb. Throughout the film, the other members of the unit, Sanborn and Eldridge become concerned about James because his methods in how he does his job as they try to find and disable or destroy bombs, and encounter other missions and danger in Iraq.  This was a very well done war movie. And I actually have a friend who was in the military who has told that this movie really hits it pretty accurately with the war in Iraq. It really displays the suspenseful things that soldiers out there face out there with the hard relationships between the troops and the Iraqis, how hard some of the choices they make can haunt them, and altogether trying to survive long enough to go home. The actors really do an extremely good job at giving us these characters and what each one of them goes through throughout the movie.  Actors/Characters Jeremy Renner/Sergent James: James was a very interesting character. He did have an interesting sort of 'I prefer my own way' kind of methods with disabling or destroying bombs, and I especially liked his line ""If I'm gonna die, I want to die comfortable."" But he did have his more serious side where he was determined to get the job done and he did really care for his unit and some times was dramatized about some pretty harsh stuff that was happening and Renner displayed all of that really well which makes it little surprise that he was nominated for Best Actor at the oscars and has make a breakthrough in his career since this movie.  Editing: I particularly liked the editing from the first scene of this film. Mostly because during one editing class I took at film school a couple of years ago, the teacher showed that particular scene and roughly took it apart and showing how every since choice of shot and time of cutting from one shot to another worked really well and I liked how much sense that makes even watching it not sometimes.  And that's my review for The Hurt Locker. It's an excellent Iraq war film that displayed a lot of things that happened around that time with very well made and acted characters that makes it probably the best Iarq war movie ever made.",The-Lords A,4.5

872,23-Aug-12,882104177,"Astonishing! and truly triumphant filmmaking. Kathryn Bigelow's Iraq war indie film is truly a masterpiece and very different then your normal motion picture. From her style she chose to direct it gives us a very documentary, live experience sort of style making you feel like your right in on all of the action. Jeremy Renner gives a mesmerizing and truly Oscar worthy performance as William James, the Staff Sgt. who leads his crew through various war zones in Iraq while disarming dangerous bombs. Renner truly became consumed by his character from his recklessness and adrenaline seeking attitude in the war, along with his vengeance and fury upon learning of the death of a young boy. Renner is no doubt one of the stars to watch as he is going to have one great career ahead of him. The supporting cast was also excellent with Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce.The war sequences itself were very realistic looking from the shootouts, sniper scenes and any scene where combat is suspected to occur. It gives the audience a sense of paranoia as to what may happen. It brings you to the edge of your seat. Truly exciting. It also gets very emotional when members of the team become injured and/or die because the way the film is constructed you feel as if you are right there with them. I also loved the scene where Renner's character goes out for blood due to the death of a young boy, this espionage scene was awesome, dark and ironically a great foreshadow to Renner's future role as a spy in The Bourne Legacy. The Hurt Locker gets you hooked from start to finish there is not one dull moment and it has an awesome but at the same time somewhat emotional ending as you know how reckless the character is and that he may have returned to face his own death. The Hurt Locker is truly worthy of the Oscar it won and is no doubt one of the best films of the decade. The best war movie since Platoon, and the best modern war movie.",Sidney S,5

210,24-Jan-15,906064001,"The Hurt Locker is an example of a film that gets pretty much everything right, and like that review that is quoted on the poster says, it is a near-perfect film. I really like the story; it builds up the tension slowly and develops in a very realistic way. Some have said that the film doesn't really have any story but I don't agree with that. It starts off with a powerful quote and then places us right in the heat of the mission and just carries on from there and I liked that approach. I thought the film would be different given the cover that has all the bombs on it. I thought that part would be the main plot point of the film with someone that made a mistake by finding them and was now stuck over all those bombs for the duration, or something, because it has been awhile since I put this on my list, so much so that the cover on RT has changed twice, and while that scene certainly had me in awe, I was happy with what it was. The film was shocking and unpredictable, much like a real war. Most of the time it felt like a horror film, especially when everyone was watching what the main characters were doing, the sense of dread that fills every scene never lets up and I was fully engaged in the story, so much so that every time a plane flew over the characters I thought a bomb was going to drop. The film has an excellent script that pays attention to its characters and they are all written excellently, there are many scenes where characters are allowed to breath and it is great to see these characters talk and interact. The cinematography was absolutely gorgeous and really enriches the experience further; the film has done an excellent job when I feel bad sitting here drinking water because the characters are almost passing out from dehydration. What was done with the budget that they had is outstanding. I'm also surprised that those little bots that they used lasted as long as they did; I thought they'd be shot down really easily. There is a scene where someone gets told to a few times to movie his car and then gets told to stop it and that just made me think about the guy in the car and how he must have felt. The cast is outstanding and everyone does an excellent job with a brilliant lead performance from Jeremy Renner. At first he seems very quiet but before long his true side is revealed and he comes across as being oddly relaxed throughout the entire mission, we learn why but it is certainly strange to see at first and our reaction is similar to the characters at that moment. He was nominated for an Oscar for this film and it was totally deserved, he totally looks the part and gave such a complex performance, he would also be nominated for an Oscar the following year, too. There was also some surprises with some actors that show up during the film and they were great to see but I still wish Guy Pearce was in it more; it's funny how the biggest names have the least screen time. Everyone else does an excellent job and I can't picture anyone else in the lead roles, especially in Renner's. Colin Farrell, Willem Dafoe and Charlize Theron were originally considered for lead roles but considering Bigelow wanted relatively unknown actors for the roles, it makes sense why they weren't chosen and Bigelow and Dafoe have worked together before too. There is a character that Jeremy Renner's character meets early into the film and those two have some scenes together and there is a part where something big seems to have happened with that storyline and that felt like such a huge coincidence at first and seemed like such a poor choice for a film like this but before long it carried on and actually went a different direction and it surprised me and I am glad what happened did. The final shot of this film is something very noteworthy to talk about. The final scene of the film is already very powerful but that final shot is perfect, the song that is playing and the way the text fades in at the end and how long they focus on it is just something I really loved and it just made my jaw drop. It was raising the score of the film the longer it went on but you can't go any higher than five stars, which is what I was already going to give it. I've seen films cover this type of theme before but here it really connected with me and it was done in such a powerful way. I will never forget this film and that ending solidified it. Speaking of the soundtrack, the soundtrack for this film is very angry and it makes sense considering who made it and what trilogy it came from. I won't say what the theme is as it might ruin some of the subtly but it fits the film very well, especially in that final scene and that song in particular also foreshadows Bigelow's next film, and it also introduced me to some awesome music.It only happened less than handful of times but slow mo is used in some scenes, and while it looked visually interesting, it felt kind of cheap to be placed in a film like this, especially when it was being used at the start. I understand why it was used but it gives the impression that it was going to be one of 'those' war films and while I personally didn't hold that against it, some might. There was also a scene with the other people on the team not really being happy with their leader and while it resolves itself, pretty much, in that one scene, I would have liked the character it is related to, to have found out at some point, it isn't a problem with the film, it is just something I find annoying in anything. I also thought some scenes ended too early, it doesn't happen very often but the scenes that do end early I think could have just gone on a little more. After taking a few years off, Kathryn Bigelow comes storming back with an excellent film, I certainly wouldn't have guessed it would win Best Picture, considering how one of the producers nearly ruined its chances, but it definitely deserves it, as well as everything else it was nominated for. That producer was talking negatively about, 'Avatar', and James Cameron was the one that convinced Bigelow to do this film, it's funny how everything works out. It is also Anthony Mackie's second time he was in a film that won Best Picture. Early in the history of the Academy it used to be Oscar 101 to make a war film but this fantastic film transcends that and I bet Bigelow is happy she changed her mind and decided to direct this film, because, like Barbara Streisand said, 'well, the time has come' and I'm really happy for her. I haven't seen K-19 as of this review but it certainly looks like this film doesn't take liberties with the facts, so not only is this a realistic take on war but is also a very powerful character study. The lowest grossing Best Picture winner of all time but that could change very soon... Tense, smart and brilliantly acted, The Hurt Locker is an excellent film from director Kathryn Bigelow and another film off the list.",Liam C,5

The most overrated piece of shite I´ve ever seen, seriously. I´m sorry, if someone claims authenticity for their picture yet fails to even get the uniforms or ranks right? ACUs in 2004 Iraq? Come on Bigelow! An E-6 (Staff Sergeant) wearing E-7 (Sergeant First Class) insignia? Seriously? An EOD drilling a moving target , 1 mile away, in the head with a 50. Cal? I dont think so. Leaving the F.O.B. without permission in the middle of the night , being caught by guards and they simply let you go? No way in hell! That´s technically going AWOL, you would be on your way to a nice prison cell in Ft. Leavenworth instantly.

760,8-Nov-12,788555028,"A US army bomb disposal tec makes waves in his new unit because of his Gung Ho attitude. The Hurt Locker is an interesting war film, mainly because its indie sensibilities make it a very unusual treatment of this subject for a product of the US movie making industry. It's quite a reserved, unsentimental film about the impact of a ""war"" that has no visible enemy; not quite in the same way as Jarhead in which the soldiers just could not find an army to face, but because the enemy hides itself in plain sight amongst the innocent population. This obviously causes great conflict within the soldiers, always unsure whether to fire or not to fire and seemingly never able to punish the perpetrators of the atrocities they witness on a daily basis. It thankfully avoids heavy-handed patriotic bullshit instead concentrating on the effects of the situation on each individual and the fine performances all round make for an interesting character study. The ""battle"" sequences are also very well staged and it is technically very accomplished on every level. The only faux pas for me was the closing scene in which ""our hero"" is striding purposefully back down a Baghdad road to a heavy metal riff which was a bit too John Wayne and seemed to be at odds with the tone of the whole of the rest of the film, but otherwise another quality war film about a very sensitive subject.",Gary C,3.5

It has your usual war torn environments and shots of soldiers trying to stay alive, but the difference with this film is that it focuses on a bomb disposal unit. This is something which is not commonly shown in films and is nice to get a focus on it. It also helps in a big way that the film was shot in Jordan. Being so close to Iraq gives you a genuine feel of watching a documentary rather than a movie. The trademark slow motion shots that Bigelow includes are also a nice welcome.The Hurt Locker also excels at the casting. Whilst now a familiar face, the movie benefited from having the unknown Jeremy Renner as the lead. It gave you the chance to connect with the character and appreciate his actions.

The entire movie felt very phony in its pretensions. That said, it wasn't preachy, at least not directly, and the acting was credible. I give lots of credit to the director for getting this movie made, but it's not much of a movie either. How could it have been improved?- by adding a political framework for the Iraqi point of view...are we just supposed to assume the usual contagion/animosity and all its stereotypical components?

With a strong cast; exceptional directing and cinematography; and a moving, often gut-wrenching thematic overtone that analyzes the fragility of the human condition through the prism of the uncertainty of war, The Hurt Locker sets a new standard for genre excellence and has solidified itself as a contemporary war movie classic.",Brandon S,4.5

My interest only increased as I became more familiar with the stars of the movie in other performances. So I was very excited to find this airing (unedited) on TV. Wow, what a powerful film. There are few movies I have seen where the realities of war felt so genuine. The way that Kathryn Bigelow chose to capture some of the scenes gave the film almost a documentary feel at times. You felt like you were really there with actual soldiers. Of course a great deal of credit for the genuine feel of the scenes also must go to the cast of actors. I connected with them, and completely bought into the idea that they were soldiers in a real war. They bickered, and also came together because of the tough situations they were facing as a team. Life-and-death isn't a strong enough term to describe the stakes they face in some of these scenes.The writing by Mark Boal is exceptional. He framed the movie nicely, opening with a scene that sets you up to understand what these guys do and how risky their job can be, then closing with a scene showing how this job can completely change them. This is easily the best performance I've ever seen from Jeremy Renner, but Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty were also brilliant. They did a nice job of showing 3 different sides of how soldiers might deal with the harsh realities of war. I almost want to say this movie was one of the best I've seen this year, but I think what kept this movie from being an all-time favorite is that they didn't quite have enough character development scenes. At times it felt like this was jumping from one set piece to the next and we were not given enough time to establish how much time had passed or whether these guys were growing closer or still at odds with one another. My least favorite scene of the film was the cliched ""let's split up"" scene that ended Eldridge's part in the story in a completely unsatisfying way. Yet the bomb disposal scenes were so intense, and felt so raw and real that I would gladly watch this movie again any time. The end even made me question what life must be like for real soldiers considering all that they see and experience. This is an excellent film, one that deserved a lot of awards.",Ben L,4.5

Where Zero Dark Thirty was definitely an adequate epic of sorts, the stagnant story - forgettable almost in its entirety - was a shockingly large letdown. The Hurt Locker is shorter, sweeter, and commands a much superior direction. Interestingly, almost all of the photography is stunningly kinetic - flaming with an undeniably awe-inspiring energy, captivating the viewer, carving intense images into the conscious. The shots are gorgeous. Slow-motion technique is used sparingly, to great success, and eye-popping HD shots of half-second events extend the phenomena to powerfully vivid proportions. Also worth realizing is Renner's terrific performance as James, the blithely flippant IED defuser.

This is simply as study of the men and women, but in this case men, who not only put their lives in danger for others, but for themselves.The performances were first rate across the board, with an inspired choice and use of cameos, such as Ralph Fiennes, who was pitch perfect, as well as the ever likable and reliable Guy Pearce, and an amusing turn by David Morse.But all these were far from through away, in fact each demonstrated a different aspect of the war junkie, with Fiennes British soldier, being one of the best. War is tough and each solider must face their own horrors of it in there own ways, but this offered a take on the horror as something that some men are bred for, but not in a monstrous way.The genius of this film is in its lead, Jeremy Renner, who is portrayed as a headcase of sorts, constantly seeking and reveling in moral danger whilst being very intelligent, skilled, disciplined, whilst given at times going too far, and most importantly, with a strong moral sense; a true soldier.This is a respectful and yet revealing war film, that deserves the kudos which it has received, and is up there with the best. The reason that I only scored it 9/10 is due to its only real flaw and that is in its pacing.It does take its time, and for the most part that is not bad thing but there are moments in which it does move a little too slowly and the narrative is quite episodic in nature, and slightly fails in fully engrossing you all of the time.This was the nature of the beast and even though I loved this film, it failed on that point for me. Otherwise, brilliant, 10/10 critically and a MUST SEE!",Marcus G,4.5

118,28-Nov-15,551848470,"I have never really enjoyed war films. I am by no means a pacifist, but to me all the stories seem to be the same, and until now, I've been uninterested. It wasn't until viewing the Academy's best picture of 2010, The Hurt Locker, that I started to see things differently. In these films, it's not so much the story line that matters, but rather the characters that are featured in the film. The description of The Hurt Locker is just as bland as any other war picture, the story of a unit in Iraq that is responsible for disarming explosives. What makes this film so unique and made it the best film of 2010 was William James, played remarkably well by Jeremy Renner. Renner is known as an action star, so when I saw him nominated for best actor, I couldn't believe it. The truth is Renner's performance in this film was outstanding, because for once, he simply played himself. Renner may have been portraying a Sargent in Iraq, but the personality was his own. Director, Kathryn Bigelow, has become known for letting actors be themselves in developing their characters personalities, to the point where even some of the dialogue was in the spur of the moment. The Hurt Locker is a powerful film, with remarkable events and heartbreaking moments, but it's the films personality that is larger than life. I enjoyed every second of this film and it was truly the best choice the Academy could have made for best picture.",Super Reviewer    Todd S,5

But it also take great strides toward artistry- the motivations behind the characters take on an unusual philosophical sophistication, and watching it you begin to understand how these characters are responding to the conflict. It's not particularly political- it prefers to focus on the notion of war itself rather than the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

It follows a trio of soldiers who are tasked with disposing explosive devices in the midst of the Iraq War, and it is one hell of a nail biting ride. This isn't so much a war movie as it is a suspense thriller, and man is this thing overflowing with suspense. Moreover, this is a very interesting type of addiction story. The whole premise of the film is that a man is addicted to the adrenaline rush of being on the very edge of death. In a way, war is a drug, and our main character's addiction to it puts him at odds with his fellow troops. It's a very unique study of the human mind in times of war, and one that has never been explored. Everyone gives fantastic performances, the special effects are just awesome, and the sound design and score are phenomenal.The Hurt Locker is a beyond intense, nail biting movie that will have you on the edge of your seat for the entire run time.

What it does not dwell upon is why this land is so burnt out in the first place and why an effective intifida is underway, with the U.S. and not the Isreali army on the receiving end. The bomb scenes are excellently done but asides such as the intrepid bomb team having to step in and save a British special ops team in a desert is just ludicrous.

726,1-Dec-12,917591648,"This is quite possibly the best war movie I've seen since ""Full Metal Jacket,"" though it seems to be less about war than any other. There are no grand battle scenes and no swelled up music score to manipulate emotion. The suspense starts with the very first scene and never lets up. Kathryn Bigalow, one of the most underrated action film directors ever, uses mostly hand-held cameras, thus putting the viewer right in the middle of the action.  Jeremy Renner is amazing in the lead role of Staff Sgt. William James. With this one film, he has gone from frequent character actor (""What movie have I seen him in?"") to a potential Best Actor Oscar nominee. His love for war is scary. He thrives on the thrill; it's his natural high. He seems more at ease when diffusing roadside bombs in Iraq than choosing a cereal while at the supermarket in civilian life.  One of the more intense scenes involves a desert shootout. There is no fast moving action; no loud music score or quick editing. We are there with the soldiers, as they take cover from terrorist snipers a few miles away across the open desert. The standoff lasts for hours as both sides wait patiently for the best shot. James and his team battle the insurgents as well as heat, fatigue, thirst, and flies.  This is truly a great film, destined to become a classic. It deserves a wide audience.

976,9-Jul-12,904904247,"The Hurt Locker tells its story by breaking it up into different episodes. Each one is titled by telling us how many days are left in this groups tour in Iraq. This is a war film about the adventures of three men during the Iraq war. It doesn't have much in the way of an overarching story, except that its characters remain (mostly) consistent throughout. While some come and go, our three men generally are always present.  We begin with the death of man tasked with defusing a bomb. It's a long scene that ends when his squadmates fail to shoot a civilian with a cell phone which ends up being the trigger. This man's replacement ends up being Sergeant James (Jeremy Renner), an overconfident young man with a wife and child back home. His group consists of Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Eldrick (Brian Geraghty). Most of the time we spend with them involves one mission or another, with downtime being skipped. They have forty days left until they can return home.  Any suspense generated is typically done in one of two forms. Either the group will be dealing with a bomb that could go off due to an error or because any random civilian could detonate it, or because snipers could be everywhere, and the group constantly has to be on guard for that. Road mines are also common, and the group's Humvee could be blown to smithereens at any moment. A quote opens the film, and it tells us that war is a drug. In many ways, I can see that's true. The Hurt Locker certainly presents itself to make sure that point gets across to the audience.  The episodic format that the narrative is told through actually works for something like this. When we just get done with one tense scene, going back to base and waiting a few days before the next one could harm the pacing. By simply skipping those parts and fast-forwarding to the next thrilling part of the solders' lives, we are always involved. There are enough character moments thrown in, but this is mostly an action-thriller. It certainly does a good job at filling both genres' expectations.  As the group goes on more missions together, tensions begin to rise. At one point, Sanborn and Eldrich contemplate killing James, making it look like an accident. It makes sense why they'd want him gone -- he is, after all, a danger to their group thanks to being an overconfident man who works with bombs for a living -- but James never finds out that they thought about it, which is surprising. There's a scene in which all three characters get drunk together, which seemed like the perfect moment to increase the tension by having it slip from one of their mouths. No such luck, I'm afraid.  The tension of the group doesn't actually last all that long, and it's eventually forgotten that they even fought. Only through a very stupid decision does it get brought up again, and even then, it's only for that one scene before it's deemed ""water under the bridge."" I get that the film wants the characters to come together and become friends, but doing it as early on as it happens here doesn't help the already-disjointed narrative. It gives us one less thing to think about, and despite director Katherine Bigalow's attempts, the characters (especially in the case of Sanborn and Eldrich) fade into the background.  Sergeant James is really the only character that gets enough development to make him relatable. He's an adrenaline junkie, someone else says, and that's a pretty apt description from where I'm sitting. But he's also funny, a risk-taker, and generally a likable guy. He even becomes friends with one of the Iraqi children who tries to sell him bootleg DVDs. But once he starts working on the bombs, he becomes focused and we get to see a real craftsman at the top of his game. It's enjoyable to watch him wherever he goes, and it makes sense for the film to focus on him.  Jeremy Renner's performance is what really makes the Sergeant's character work. It's a very subdued job, although he's pretty much the perfect actor for this type of role. He can be cocky, he can be confident, and he's athletic enough to perform in the actions. But he's also kind of an everyman. Mackie and Geraghtly are relegated to supporting detail, but despite that, they're strong and make what little character they're given work. Other supporting roles -- in these cases, the characters usually appear once and then aren't seen again -- go to Guy Pearce, David Morse, Christian Camargo, Ralph Fiennes, and Evangeline Lilly.  If nothing else, The Hurt Locker feels very authentic. I don't know if it actually is -- I have a hard time believing some of the things these soldiers get away with could actually happen -- but the way it looks and feels makes you feel like you've just experienced war. It's a very gritty filming style, primarily consisting of handheld shots, but it works well in this case. The action scenes are all very intense, and you feel that, at any point, the lives of these people could be at an end.  The Hurt Locker is a very exciting movie about the Iraq war. It contains a solid lead performance from Jeremy Renner, has nerve-racking action scenes, and works well telling this one man's story, even if that means the supporting cast is ultimately inconsequential. It feels real, it looks real, and it's a fine journey to experience. I was never bored while watching it, and while it has a few flaws, they're easy to look past both while watching and afterward. Definitely give this film a watch.",Matthew P,4
634,15-Jan-13,901162483,"Great war movie. Suspense is executed excellently, specially because the viewer is submerged into a very realistic-looking (no idea how it compares to the real thing) combat. When the bombs are not ticking, there's a sniper ready to kill off any of the protagonists. The movie succeeds in making you want it to finish as soon as possible, thus reducing the casualties. Still, not convinced with the character development, specially since they had two hours for just three soldiers. There's the super-hero, the young candidate for PTSD and the black guy, who can be all he can be, except as good as the white guy.",Tomas S,4

45,18-Mar-17,976171437,Kathryn Bigelow's movie is a portrait of the Iraq War. The acting is incredible as the plot.

43,4-Apr-17,967693587,"This isn't on the same level as Black Hawk Down is but the Hurt Locker is still another thrilling, well-acted, and fairly original movie about the Iraq War which is definitely worth a watch.This movie follows 3 soldiers in the Iraq War. They are trained to disarm bombs and they face the threat of death every day as anyone could try to kill them as seen in the beginning of the movie.In most war films, armies face each other directly and battle. In this movie though, the enemy hides in plain sight and the soldiers have no way of knowing who can be trying to kill them. Often when they disarm bombs, several possibly dangerous people watch them and any one of them could try to kill them as is shown in the intro. This of course creates conflict between the troops and this movie explains some of the conflict that arises between them.The scenes where they disarm bombs are very tense because the viewer knows that the bombs could go off at any second. This is made clear from the memorable opening scene. The movie also brings in factors which helps to raise tension even more. It shows several possibly dangerous onlookers, a man driving a taxi within the bomb site, and a man holding a remote which may possibly set off the bombs. The shootout scene near the middle isn't that impressive compared to other scenes in the movie In terms of originality and suspense but it doesn't take up too much time to begin with.The acting is pretty good. Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty were the main actors and they carried the movie well. They don't have too much of a variety in terms of their facial expressions and emotions but they still do their best in the movie and they show that they are talented actors.A common problem found in many war films is the lack of character development. Like many other movies of the genre, this movie also suffers from that problem. The movie doesn't give us something big which makes us care for any of the characters. This is a common problem which arises in many war films nowadays and I hope that it will be fixed sometime in the future.Despite the lack of character development, this is still a great war film which contains some pretty memorable and original scenes which hold a lot of tension often. It is definitely worth a watch and it is one of the better war films in recent memory.",Brian B,3.5

5,20-Mar-18,896729812,"Kathryn Bigelow brings a unique vision to the modern day war epic. This film has unique and stunning cinematography and outstanding performances that really makes this film a standout in its genre. The way its written and filmed feels like a documentary with each segment really making you feel like you're there. In regards to Mark Boal's screenplay I must say I appreciate how he tells stories we don't typically see in this genre such as; the diffusing of bombs in both its relieving success and tragic failures, the long time and focus it takes to be a sniper and mercenaries privately contracted to capture/kill terrorists themselves. I could go on about the cast but it's really Jeremy Renner's show playing a soldier thats so desensitived by war that he feels more comfortable in that environment then safe back home.

I thought it was very interesting to watch about an elite group of US Army soldiers: Jeremy Renner (S.W.A.T.), Anthony Mackie (Notorious) and Brian Geraghty (Jarhead) who, and while on their tour of duty in Iraq, have one of the most dangerous jobs: Disarming bombs in the heat of combat. Kathryn Bigelow directed a very intense and visually stunning movie that earned her the Academy Award for Best director and being the first female director in history to win it. I liked how the sound was used in the explosion scenes and how it also won the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing. The performances of Renner as the courageous Sgt. 1st Class William James and Mackie as the by the book Sgt. J.T. Sanborn I thought were both excellent. They somehow remind of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon. I thought Geraghtyâ??s performance as the young tough Owen Eldridge was good and I loved how Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential), David Morse (The Rock), Evangeline Lilly (TVâ??s Lost), and Ralph Fiennes (Schindlerâ??s List) made special appearances in this movie.
